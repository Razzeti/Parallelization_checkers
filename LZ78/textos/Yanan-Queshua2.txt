Evidence For The Name: The book that can prove The Name of The Most
High and His Son!
Copyright © 2013 by Y'anah Kathath
Born in California, new author and commentator Y`anah Kathath, aka Shirley Jo Davis/JoeyD, has
studied both in the United States and abroad. She has worked as editor, and compiler on the book
“Articles of the Hebrew Scriptures”, as well as, “Articles of the Hebrew Scriptures, second edition”.
After four years of research on the trans-Atlantic Slave Trade, and the fate of the 12 tribes of Israel,
known today as “Yasharål” in many black communities, Y`anah Kathath has authored the controversial
article “A Slave Trade Commentary – Eyes White Open”.

Y`anah Kathath has written several dozen studies on the Hebrew Scriptures for private use, as well as
delving into the comprehensive study of The Name of Yahuah and Yahusha. She has been a student of
the Modern Hebrew for more than five years. And now, Y`anah Kathath takes on the critics as well as
the authors of old; and challenges in a new way, those who claim that the Name of our Creator can not
be known. Finally, new incite to this age old dilemma is revealed. With courage and conviction, she has
come out with her most dramatic, and extensive work to date, “Evidence for the Name”.

Throughout my endeavor to complete this project inside of six years, my knowledge of The Name of hwhy has
broadened as well as my understanding; and my love for The Name of hwhy has deepened tremendously! My hope, is
that in your search for the truth, you will gain a genuine love for This Name hwhy as well.




Acts 17:11 These were more noble than those in Thessalonica, in that they received the word with all readiness of mind, and searched
                                    the scriptures daily, to see whether those things were so.




YashâYahū/Isa 63:16 For You are our Father, though Åbraham does not know us, and Yasharʿål does not recognise us. You,                              ‫יהוה‬,
                                 are our Father, our Redeemer – Your Name is from of old.
                                                                                                       Page 6 of 396


                                           Think about it…

   Have you ever wondered, why translators use the English letter “J” to replace the Hebrew letter ‫( י‬yad) at the
    beginning of a Hebrew name when transliterating? The yad has a “Y” sound. Not a “J” sound.

   Have you ever wondered, why God is used as a generic name for every religion in the earth?



   Have you ever wondered, where the foretelling of The Name of our Savior is written in the Hebrew text?



   Have you ever wondered, why we are so comfortable studying the bible in the English language without
    verifying the translation in the original Hebrew text?

   Have you ever wondered, why the name Jesus is Greek when the Mashýacḥ’s name is of Hebrew origin?

   Have you ever wondered, why Jehovah, Yahweh, THE LORD and Yehovee are used as some of the names of The
    Most High when He refers to His Name as singular only?

   Have you ever wondered, if the attributes of a name can be confused for The Name itself?

   Have you ever wondered, what the 3rd commandment really means when it commands us not to ruin The
    Name? We have to know what The Name is in order to fulfill this command.

   Have you ever wondered, why English translators omit “Yahū” from transliterated Hebrew names?

   Have you ever wondered, why there are vowel points all over the Masoretic text when there aren’t any to be
    found in the Dead Sea scrolls or the Qumran scrolls?

   Have you ever wondered, why “Kurios” and “Theos” are used in the New Testament when The Name of The
    Most High and “Ålahým” is quoted from the Old Testament?

   Have you ever wondered, if The Most High ever referred to Himself as God?

   Have you ever wondered, why the name Joshua is transliterated from a Hebrew name without a “shua” suffix?

   Have you ever wondered, why people keep saying we cannot know the pronunciation of The Name of The Most
    High, when the foretelling’s of the end days proclaim His Name will be known to the nations?

   Have you ever wondered, why we believe it’s ok to call The Most High anything we want when He punished His
    own people for replacing His Name with Bʿâl (LORD)?

   Have you ever wondered, why the Jews have made it a law to not speak The Name of The Most High as it is
    written, but replace His Name with other names and titles using vowel points? This breaks the 3rd command.

                                For those who only know what they have been told;
                                      not what they have dug up themselves.

                                                     Diacritic Chart
          This chart serves as a guide to help you better understand the pronunciation of words in this book
                  – Dasia = used for a glottal stop – B al (b – al) (when ‫ א‬or ‫ ע‬is not at the end of a word)
                   Å (å) – Ring Above = pronounced ‘a’ as in “What” – (Åbram) this Å represents the ‫א‬
                  Â (â) – Circumflex = pronounced ‘a’ as in ‘Spa’ – (B ʿår-shabâ) this Â represents the ‫ע‬
          Âū – Circumflex/Macron = together has the ‘o’ sound as in ‘Oh’ - (Âūbad) this Âū represents the ‫עו‬
           Åŭ) – Ring/Breve = together pronounced as ‘au’ as in Austin – (ÅŭrYah) this Åῠ represents the ‫או‬
     Cḥ - the underdot = makes a guttural sound as in the German ‘Bach’ – (NacḥamYah) this cḥ represents the ‫ח‬
Ṭ (ṭ) – diphthong = makes a hard ‘t’ sound as in ‘Take’ (when ‫ ת‬begins a Hebrew word) – (Ṭahalým) this Ṭ represents the ‫ת‬
ṭh – diphthong = makes a ‘dt’ sound as in ‘ Schmidt (when ‫ ת‬in not at the beginning of a Hebrew word) – (MaṭhaṭhYahu)
                                                   this ṭh represents the ‫ת‬
       Ū – Macron = makes the double ‘oo’ sound as in ‘Tool’ – (Yarūshalam) (Yahūdah) this ū represents the ‫ו‬
   Ý – Accent Acute = makes the double ‘ee’ sound as in ‘Bee’ (when ‫ י‬does not begin a Hebrew word) – (Mýkʿål) this ý
 represents the ‫י‬. When this character is at the beginning of a Hebrew word, it carries the Y sound as in “York.” (Yarūshalam)


       Right Half Ring = used only in the case of “aa”: Parâʾah/‫ פרעה‬- suggesting glottal stop between double ‘aa’

                                  *These marks are used at the discretion of the Author*


When viewing the transliterated words from the Hebrew text in this book, you will discover some sounds these letters
carry, are not found in the English language. Some rules of this language are similar to ours and others are not. I have
created the above chart to help you identify transliterated sounds through the use of these marks. Most transliterated words
from the Hebrew are quite easy to read without help because it is largely a language of consonants. But because we are
not familiar with its few unique sounds, these marks are needed to point out which Hebrew characters are making these
sounds, and when these sounds are accompanied by another character. The laws of letters and sounds we have been given,
are chaotic. A perfect example of what I am implying is the letter “U” in the English language and how it is used.

In our language this letter can be used as a Y as in the case of used. Yet the Y is not present in the word used. The first
letter in used is pronounced the same as the first letter in yellow. It can also be used as au as in the case of caught when
accompanied by the gh. But in the case of the o in shot the sound is the same (Caught/Shot). However, if we compare
caught with laugh we cannot get the same sound from the a even though the u has not moved from its vowel position.
We have been raised to embrace an extremely confusing set of laws in this English language, which makes no reasonable
sense at all. This will take work to undo when learning this Hebrew language.

As for the most difficult sounds in the Hebrew, I have tried my best to explain these sounds in writing. I do encourage you
to embark on your own search, on the internet, for sound bites of these letters: ‫ כ‬- ‫ ק‬- ‫ צ‬- ‫ ע‬- ‫ח‬
These characters can be tricky for some people (with the exception of the ‫ )כ‬depending on their ability to hear and speak
new sounds. However, these characters will not create a problem when learning The Name of The Father or The Name of
His Son.
                                                                                                                Page 9 of 396

One particular sound, “Glottal stop” that is common in the Hebrew is also common in English. We just don’t know we use
it- until someone tells us about it. Observe:



ʿ   = a small glottal stop. Example: Yasharʿål/‫ – ישראל‬Bʿâlah/‫( בעלה‬In a transliterated name I don’t use this symbol if the “a”

originates from the âýn or ålaph at the end of the Hebrew name: Åså/‫ אסא‬and   Ålyashâ/‫ )אלישע‬-no glottal stop here-

Glottal stop – “We often make this “stop” in English–it’s the sound we make when we say ‘uh-oh.’
Noun Phonetics.
   B. A plosive consonant whose occlusion and release are accomplished chiefly at the glottis, as in the Scottish
      articulation of the t- sound of little, bottle, etc. (listening to the accent of the Scottish people will help)
(http://dictionary.reference.com/browse/glottal+stop?s=t)

- in phonetics, a momentary check on the airstream caused by closing the glottis (the space between the vocal cords) and
thereby stopping the vibration of the vocal cords. Upon release, there is a slight choke, or cough like explosive sound. The
glottal stop is not a separate phoneme (or distinctive sound) in English, though it is one of the allophones of the t phoneme
in some dialects (as in Cockney or Brooklynese “bo’l” for “bottle”).
(http://www.britannica.com/EBchecked/topic/235680/glottal-stop)

The Guttural is a sound that comes from this character: ‫( ח‬Cḥat) not to be confused with the traditional “ch” sound.
It can be easily confused with this character: ‫( ה‬Ha)

Guttural – the sound you hear when someone is trying to violently push phlegm out of their throat.
Phonetics. Pertaining to or characterized by a sound articulated in the back of the mouth, as the non-English velar fricative
sound. (http://dictionary.reference.com/browse/gutturals)

When this character ‫( ק‬Quph) is used, it is transliterated with the English Q. However, a slight characteristic is embedded
within its sound. It carries a “qo” sound. This is what distinguishes the sound difference from the Hebrew ‫( כ‬Kaph)
which carries a simple “K” sound. Example:

                                Y ʿâqb is transliterated from these Hebrew characters: ‫יעקב‬

This Hebrew language is read “backwards” as opposed to our English language. Consequently, that would make the first
character in this name, Y ʿâqb, the (yad) ‫י‬. A glottal stop is placed between the first two characters. That is what this ʿ
symbol tells you when reading Y ʿâqb in this book. It instructs you to pronounce the Y sound, then stop. Start again, and
pronounce the ʿâqb. Phonetic: y-aqob. The symbol over the â is to let you know the ‫( ע‬Âýn) was the character source in
the English transliteration of that sound. This is necessary because the ‫( א‬Ålaph) is similar in sound. After listening to
the Arabic language for awhile it has given me a better understanding of these two characters and their differences. The ‫ע‬
requires the mouth to be opened a bit more with the tongue pulled back into the throat. This takes practice. The ‫ א‬has a
softer “aw” sound as in “otter”. When this character’s sound is transliterated it is done with this symbol: å

As you can see, there is good reason for the use of these marks. They are to help you identify which characters are the
Hebrew source letters in the transliteration to English as you learn their sounds. The following chart will help you learn
the remaining characters:
                                                                                                                      Page 10 of 396

The purpose of this project is to bring to the reader’s attention the Name of The Creator; typically seen outside of the
English translation as ‫יהוה‬, from the Modern Hebrew (Aramaic mix) script and,                 hwhy from the ancient or Paleo script.
This Name ‫יהוה‬, and most, if not all of the controversies surrounding The Name are thoroughly investigated. The
inhabitants of the earth have been sightless to the significance of This particular Name. During the course of my learning
the pronunciation of ‫יהוה‬, I have learned of many errors surrounding This Name. The online Wikipedia states:

The term Tetragrammaton (from Greek τετραγράμματον, meaning “four letters”) refers to the Hebrew (Hebrew: ‫ )יהוה‬transliterated
to the Latin letters YHWH. It may be derived from the verb that means “to be”, and is considered in Judaism to be the proper name of
the God of Israel used in the Hebrew Bible.

Scholars widely propose that the name YHWH is a verb form derived from the Biblical Hebrew triconsonantal root ‫( היה‬h-y-h) “to be”,
which has ‫( הוה‬h-w-h) as a variant form, with a third person masculine y- prefix. It is connected to the passage in Exodus 3:14 in
which God gives his name as ‫( אֶ ְהיֶה אֲ ֶשׁר אֶ ְהיֶה‬Ehyeh Asher Ehyeh), translated most basically as “I am that I am” (or “I Will Be What I
Will Be”, “I Will Be What I Am”). ‫ יהוה‬with the vocalization “Yahweh” could theoretically be a hif’il (causative) verb inflection of root
HWH, with a meaning something like “he who causes to exist” or “who gives life” (the root idea of the word being “to breathe”, and
hence, “to live”). As a qal (basic stem) verb inflection, it could mean “he who is, who exists”.

The evidence in this book will clearly show the hidden errors stated in the above “Wikipedia” insert. This error among
others, ( ‫( היה‬h-y-h) “to be” ) commonly associated with This Name ‫יהוה‬, is printed in most of our study materials.
Consequently, this has become a deadly stumbling block to almost every student of the scriptures. When I first learned of
this error, I was urged to take a second look at how this word was used throughout the Hebrew/Aramaic text. Then, I did
the same for these characters: ‫יהוה‬. When I did that simple task, it changed my understanding of Shamūṭh/Ex 3:14-15.
One is used as a name in the Hebrew text, the other is not. Looking through these pages, I hope, will not only bring
encouragement to study The Name of ‫יהוה‬, but also give knowledge and understanding on how to study The Name.

I have collected 156 Hebrew names from the scriptures, and listed them as witnesses to The Name of The Father. These
names were ruined; or changed concealing the portion of His Name, which validates with unrelenting certainty the
primary characteristic: Self-Existence. The testimony of these witnesses exposes a worldwide deception that has caused
countless billions to stumble by calling on the name of another. We have all been led to believe that The Creator has a
Name which is tolerant to change. A warning was given through the written commandment in the scriptures concerning
this transgression: Shamūṭh/Ex 20:7

  “You shall not lift up (speak) ‫ את‬The Name of ‫ יהוה‬your Ålahým to ruin it, for ‫ את יהוה‬will not acquit (pardon) anyone
                                      who lifts up (speaks) ‫ את‬His Name to ruin it.”

I have collected over 400 scripture verses referencing The Name, from B-rʿåshýṭh/Genesis to Cḥazūn/Revelation. This
collection of verses, surrounding The Name of ‫יהוה‬, are listed to expose the importance of This Name; which has been
replaced with other names and titles in our English translations. This includes the Greek titles, “Theos” and “Kurios” used
as replacements for The Name in “The Septuagint”. Furthermore, this study will reveal that the spelling, pronunciation,
and authority of This Name; have never changed. The evidence surrounding The Name of The Father ‫יהוה‬, raises
suspicions against leading translators tampering with the transliteration of The Name (for whatever reason) and has
changed This Name into several different names through vowel pointing. These ruined forms of The Fathers Name, and
ruined forms of The Name of His Son, have been “lifted up” (spoken) by billions of people; unknowingly ruining His
Name.
                                                                                                           Page 13 of 396

I find it strange and quite frankly, offensive that when New Testament writers are quoting Old Testament writings; almost
every word remains consistent with one exception: THE NAME. The Name is always changed in the quote. Regardless of
how many years I have been drilled by Christian leaders using scripture, to teach of one name to call on for salvation, I
was also taught to excuse the authority of what was written; and accept many other names as well. I have been taught to
accept a name that cannot be found in the Hebrew text; and is not consistent with the transliteration of the The Name
foretold to be The Branch: our Saviors Name written in ZakarYah/Zech 6:11-12. It is a dangerous thing to change The
Fathers Name and The Name of His Son, because I have learned that the meaning also changes.

This Name, with the meaning “Self-Existent”, is clearly evident in the 156 Hebrew names of the Nabýʿåým (prophets);
kings, and servants of the Most High, listed in section 4 of this project. Many of these names, including The Name of The
Son, carry the first 3 letters of The Father’s Name. The acts of the Masorites, and emendations inflicted on The Name of
The Most High, are discussed in this book. We can learn how The Name ‫ יהוה‬is pronounced prior to Masoretic authority,
by observing the corrected form of these Hebrew names, through the consistency of the Hebrew text, already established
centuries ago: as it is written.

Consider these findings, and what has been brought to the surface. This project reveals; This Name ‫ יהוה‬and ‫ יהושע‬to be
so important, with witnesses; and evidence so compelling, that our salvation could depend on the outcome of our decision
regarding the authority of This Name, the authority of the scriptures, and how we speak This Name. Let’s look at the
evidence!

     My computer software “TheWord” lists This Hebrew Name ‫( יהוה‬Yahūah) 6,076 times in the TS98 version of the

 In 2010, after learning of our Creators Name, and how much evidence there was in the Hebrew text; bearing witness to
His Name and the pronunciation, I was compelled to create a graphic for a poster that listed as many Hebrew names I
could find (*having a primary root connection to H3050 or H3068). After the graphic was finished, I wanted to have it
sent off to a print company for display in my living room as a conversation piece. But the graphic all by itself was
incomplete, no matter how much I tried to ignore it. It was imperative to have an “accessory” poster listing the scriptures
the Hebrew names were found in. Far be it from me not to have an adequate answer for anyone who asks, “Where are
these names found? Did you see them for yourself, written in the scripture?” I wanted to be able to answer to the
affirmative, on every name on the graphic. So, I began creating a word document with the information I needed on each
name. I never imagined that my graphic design would eventually lead me into a work of this magnitude. I had no idea
how ill-equipped I was for this endeavor. Because you see, the more information you dig up referencing The Name of
Yahūah, the deeper The Name gets; it’s bottomless, eternal. The ideas from the information I was collecting began to
grow exponentially. That’s how fast a poster can transform into a book when you’re not looking! Needless to say, only
digging up addresses where those Hebrew names were found was not going to be sufficient for this growing mountain of
ideas. The graphic did make it to the front cover of this book by the way, but was only intended to be hung on my living
room wall. Eventually, I would have to confess that I bit off more than I could chew. I hope someday, I can finally see
that poster on my wall.

The world of Christianity taught me of a name associated with the phrase, “It is The Name above every name!” (Phil 2:9)
Through all my years of practicing Christianity, not one evangelist, pastor, teacher or fellow bible thumper asked me if I
could find or prove the foretelling of the Name of the Savior; or, The Name of the Father in the Hebrew text. Now I know
why I was never asked for proof; because they never knew The Name, or where to find it, or how to prove it themselves.
Proving The Name was never a concern in the Christian circles I was in. I even spoke out in Sunday school class one
morning at a Baptist church. I said, “If I only knew where the prophesied Name of our Savior was in the Old Testament; I
would then be able to show people where it is! Wouldn’t it be great if we knew where it was?” You could have heard a pin
drop in the class that day. Nobody knew where His Name was foretold; not even the teacher. Why didn’t I get a response
out of someone that day? Aren’t they interested at all about the fortelling of The Name to even look into it?

Some people believe that The Name of the Creator was written in Genesis 1:1 of the English translation. Others believe
what the Jews teach on this (‫ )יהוה‬Name. Never in my wildest dreams would it ever occur to me to study the Hebrew text;
to make sure the English translation agreed with its source, until a dear brother challenged me on it. It was then that I
realized, I did not know how to study the Hebrew text; to verify what Christian leaders have been teaching me. The reality
of my inability to “Prove all things and hold fast to that which is good” uncovered a gnawing curiosity, buried deep within
my intellect. Can the pronunciation of this four letter Name (‫ )יהוה‬somehow be known after all these centuries?

There have been many documents written claiming there is no way to prove the pronunciation of This Name. I have read
in various sources; the arguments and debates that say something like, we can never know for certain, what the
pronunciation of The Name really is. Too much time has gone by. Too much evidence has been lost or destroyed. The
language barriers are too strong. I found it intriguing to step into an investigation, regarding this debate, and its
documented conclusions. Searching the internet for historical evidence; from artifacts, to the Dead Sea scrolls, to
conflicting beliefs from the Jewish community; became the norm in my daily routine. Later, I learned how vowel points
seemed to be a stumbling block for millions around the world. It became quite clear to me that using vowel points to
change a name into another, and alter its meaning, was quite easy to accomplish without causing a stir.

Witnesses who testify to the pronunciation of The Name ‫( יהוה‬Yahūah) such as, MaṭhaṭhYahū, YaramYahū, YashâYahū,
ÂbadYahū, Yahūshâ, Yahūdah and Yahūcḥanan are just a few of the names listed in this project, that have been hidden in
plain sight. Names we thought were Matthew, Jeremiah, Isaiah, Obadiah, Joshua, Judah and John.
                                                                                                               Page 17 of 396

According to the list of scriptures referencing The Name, there are an alarming number of them indicating; that there has
always been only one Name we can call on for salvation, and is clearly visible in the Hebrew text.(Yahūʿål/Joel 2:32 Acts 2:21;
4:12 YashâYahū/Is 45:21).

During the course of this study, I have found that there are many attributes to This One Name. These attributes, or
characteristics rather, have been confused for the actual Name of The Father in many Christian circles. I remember buying
a book several years ago that was titled something like, “The Many Names of God”. This book listed characteristics such
as, El Shaddai; Nissi; Tsidkenu; and Jireh. These are a few attributes, that many of us are familiar with referencing, A
Name: The Name of Yahūah; The Name that His Son, Yahūshâ was sent in; who are Ålahým. This book I purchased,
listed characteristics of one name. The author ignorantly tried to pawn them off as The Creator’s many names; while
breaking the third commandment. This commandment states that His Name is singular, not plural in form. I am amazed at
how many times I have read this commandment myself and yet; was completely blind to what it was saying. Someone
once said, “Sin hides in ignorance.” It is evident that many are sleeping in this dark age of falsehood, not knowing where
to find The Name to call on for salvation in the Hebrew scriptures; much less how to prove it.

Below is a list of words I use in this book that replaces commonly used words in many Bible translations. I have replaced
them by reason of their origin, and within the comfort of my own discretion. Please be liberal in your own research on
these words. The finer points of this subject can be found in the Glossary of this book found on page 355.

Aside from the efforts I express to prove The Name of our Creator in this book, I share corrected transliteration of names
and titles found in the Hebrew Scriptures. This includes names of geographical locations referred to in the text, as well as
the book titles. Many Bible translations of today, seem to fall short of correct transliteration of names and titles. Below is
an example of curious errors I have found, in several Bible translations, of two names listed in section 4.

First Name in Hebrew:                                            Correct letter for letter transliteration:
‫ – חזקיהו‬This name was transliterated as HEZEKIAH                  Chzqyhu – CḥazaqYahū

Second Name in Hebrew:
‫ – יחזקיהו‬This name was transliterated as HEZEKIAH                 Ychzqyhu – YacḥazaqYahū

What I find curious about this error, is that both names carry the YHU portion of The Name of Yahūah, and one carries an
extra letter. Those who are well educated in the Hebrew, and well educated in the controversial arguments of the vowel
points, still to this day, violate a literal transliteration of these names; even in the most recent translation of the scriptures.

Throughout these pages, you will find that I have selected various authors who’s research on The Name of The Most
High; reveal informative criteria essential to understanding the full spectrum, of why I deemed it necessary to address
every possible argument on This Name Yahūah, and The Mashýacḥ, Yahūshâ.

Please understand, that I don’t intend to impose on the student reading this book, that I have all the answers, or that I am
immune from mistakes, or could not possibly overlook information that could tip the balance in any given subject matter.
What I do intend to impose, is the importance of learning how to pull back an age old carpet of English translation; as old
as the fifth century, and discover a hidden world with a heritage more valuable than our own.

While I type in the last few narratives of this book, I often ponder how I would have viewed this book 7 years ago, had I
come across it; not knowing how to study the scriptures, or know where to find proof of The Name of my Savior. This is a
troubling condition to find yourself in when it is brought to your attention. This skill of study that was handed down to
me, is what I hope will be passed down to the next student; the next poor soul who just doesn’t know where to start. With
this skill, treasure can be found in the Scriptures by those who hunger and thirst for Righteousness. To love my neighbor
as myself, in this context, is to hand down to the newcomers what I would have loved to discover while I was being
shepherded out of paganism.

After learning The Name of The Father Yahūah, (‫ )יהוה‬and His Son Yahūshâ, (‫ )יהושע‬and their locations in the Hebrew
text, I am learning how to love and fear This Name (YashâYahū/Isa 59:19 Ṭahalým/Ps 5:11; 119:132). I give thanks and esteem to
The Name of Yahūah; The Name I defend and proclaim throughout this book; The Name found in, ‘The Word manifested
in the flesh’, sent to mankind for deliverance; His Son, Yahūshâ.

   If the third commandment requires us to guard The Name, we most certainly would need to know which
                        name to guard. This then should compel us to seek it out!

Section 1: Chap. 1



Welcome young ladies and mothers! Prepare to put your mind to work; it is time to get our study on. Learning how to study is key to
uncovering deception in these last days. This includes using study tools which are a requirement and a privilege. This consists of
necessary information that you did not expect you would need, in order to dig for truth. There is good news and bad news. First, the
bad news. There are two things that are required when learning how to study the scriptures:

1. Knowing how to use various dictionaries and lexicons.
2. Familiarizing yourself with the Hebrew/Aramaic language: ‫ת‬     ‫אבגדהוזחטיכךלמםנןסעפףצץקרש‬
You absolutely need to know how to identify these letters and what sounds these letters make. If you do not discipline yourself to get
familiar with the letters of the Hebrew, you will never be equipped to prove anything in the scriptures. Period. Whether you like it or
not, you have to bite down on that. Why? Because the message of salvation has been given to us in that language. We are forced to
familiarize ourselves with that language because The Name of the Father is in that language as well as The Name of His son. This will
demand discipline. The good news—I have prepared this book for you which is geared to simplify this overwhelming task. For those
who are wondering about the Greek language and its demands in The New Testament: learning the letters of the Greek is wise for the
disciplined student. I have created a *Greek chart for you on page 11. In this book, I will be focusing on the Hebrew only.

For those of you who are not new to Hebrew, please be patient. There are new students reading these pages, who only know what they
have been told. They have no idea how to prove what they believe through the Hebrew Scriptures. Please respect this and try not to get
annoyed at the elementary sections of this book. It will all payoff in the end for everyone.

Now, as I take you through this brief study, I won’t be giving you all the answers. You will learn how to find them on your own. This
step by step guide is meant to take the confusion and fear out of using study tools; with Strong’s reference numbers and their
definitions for first time users. Learning to navigate through unnecessary information, whether online or using hard copies, while
viewing the actual Hebrew text will become an invaluable skill. This will help you spot spelling errors in the Hebrew, phonetic errors,
misleading information and much more. This brief study will take you through the “Thayer’s Greek Lexicon”, the “Strong’s
Dictionary of Bible Words”, the “Brown-Driver-Briggs Hebrew and English Lexicon” and the “Blue Letter Bible Online Lexicon”
while focusing on a single “Strong’s” reference number. Let’s get busy!

                                        The Thayer’s Greek Lexicon lists the G2424 as:
G2424
- Original: Ἰησοῦς
- Transliteration: Iesous
- Phonetic: ee-ay-sooce'
- Definition: Jesus = "Jehovah is salvation"
   1. Jesus, the Son of God, the Saviour of mankind, God incarnate
   2. Jesus Barabbas was the captive robber whom the Jews begged Pilate to release instead of Christ
   3. Joshua was the famous captain of the Israelites, Moses' successor (Ac. 7:45, Heb. 4:
   4. Jesus, son of Eliezer, one of the ancestors of Christ (Lu. 3:
   5. Jesus, surnamed Justus, a Jewish Christian, an associate with Paul in the preaching of the gospel (Col. 4:
- Origin: of Hebrew origin H3091


Most of this information is self-explanatory. What students struggle with is how to use this information in their searches. What do
these numbers mean and what advantage do they give me in my studies? Let’s start from scratch.




*Greek chart: (a better view of the original Greek chart not converted to a jpg. format is available on p. 392)
                                                                                                                           Page 23 of 396

                                 Here are two passages of scripture without Strong’s reference numbers:
NET: from New English Translation of the Bible
1Tim 6:14 to  obey this command without fault or failure until the appearing of our Lord Jesus Christ
1Tim 6:15 –   whose appearing the blessed and only Sovereign, the King of kings and Lord of lords, will reveal at the right time.


                                    Here are the same two scriptures with Strong’s reference numbers:
KJV: from King James Version of the Bible
 1Tim 6:14 That thou G4571 keep G5083 this commandment G1785 without spot G784, unrebukeable G423, until G3360 the appearing
G2015
      of our G2257 Lord G2962 Jesus G2424 Christ G5547:
                   G3739
1Tim 6:15 Which         in his G2398 times G2540 he shall shew G1166, who G3588 is the blessed G3107 and G2532 only G3441 Potentate
G1413
      , the King G935 of kings G936, and G2532 Lord G2962 of lords G2961;

While viewing all of this at face value, it seems that the reference number G2424 agrees with the English text. After all, the “Thayer’s
Greek Lexicon” says that the savior of mankind is Iesous, transliterated as, Jesus-- right? How is this information any good to us if we
don’t know how to look into the original text to “see if these things are so?” Looking at the very bottom of the “Thayer’s” entry, there
is something quite interesting:

- Origin: of Hebrew origin H3091 Remember, Hebrew is read right to left or “backwards”

This is a number (H3091) most of us have overlooked. Why? Because we don’t know how to read Hebrew. Who wants to wrestle with
that? I can hear it now, from the younger ladies, “Man, I got kids to raise, dinner on the stove and a boss breathing down my neck!
Where will I find room in my schedule?” I’m sure the teenagers are thinking, “C’mon Y`anah, I’m too busy trying to find myself right
now. Ain’t nobody got time for that! And besides, I haven’t heard anything on facebook about that.” I can hear grandma say, “I’m too
tired. What I have learned from the church so far is what I am comfortable with. The church is not proving The Name, why should I?”
The sad part about that is, most bible students expect the pastor, or the teacher, to dig through all the hard stuff, and serve it to us on a
silver platter, trusting him to deliver to us what we need to know. This way we can all kick back, and graze on all the easy, without
any thought about the trance we are falling into. This is when we begin to train ourselves to think, “I don’t have to work at digging for
origins of words! The teachers can’t be wrong, so there is no need to “check” them or the translation that was given to me.” When
that snare is set, we will feed on everything these teachers tell us because we don’t know how to prove anything we have been taught.
Put down the fear of finding out you may have been deceived all your life, and check the scribes, check the pastors, the teachers, the
translation and everything you have been led to believe is the truth. Be prepared though; the truth is never comfortable. And it’s never
easy to find. Let us begin.


The name Jesus has a number assigned to it, as do most words and names in the Greek and Hebrew texts. This number is the G2424.
We will look at this entry one line at a time:

- Original: Ἰησοῦς - this identifies the Greek name in the Greek language
- Transliteration: Iesous – this is the transliteration of the same name from Greek to English
- Phonetic: ee-ay-sooce' – this is the aid of pronunciation for the same name in Greek
- Definition: Jesus = "Jehovah is salvation" - this is what the “Thayer’s” says this name means. That has to be proven!

At the bottom of this entry, we see this: - Origin: of Hebrew origin H3091
This name Jesus, according to the “Thayer’s”, has a Hebrew origin. This number, H3091 requires looking into. So how do we do it?
What will it tell us?

If you are using a digital book such as “TheWord” software which includes various lexicons, dictionaries, bible translations and
Hebrew sources, just click on the number. It will be very simple to follow along with me using this software. The “G” is representative
of the Greek list of bible words in the New Testament (NT). The “H” is representative of the Hebrew list of bible words in the Old
Testament (OT). When the number has an “H” in front of it, this would then require a lexicon that has a Hebrew list of words, which
these numbers represent. The “Brown-Driver-Briggs Hebrew/English Lexicon” (with “Strong’s” numbers) is an excellent choice. The
first book I used, was the “Strong’s Dictionary of Bible Words”. This book is fairly simple to use for beginners. Let’s start with that
one.
                                                                                                                                         Page 24 of 396

This fantastic starter tool; with built in English/Hebrew/Greek tabs on the edge of the pages, has an English word index at the
beginning of the book, a Hebrew/Aramaic Dictionary in the middle, then, it gives you a Greek Dictionary at the end. The number we
want to bust open is the H3091. Turn to the Hebrew section of the Book and simply look up the 3091 number. These numbers are in
chronological order. Just make certain that you are in the Hebrew section. There are four lines I have numbered for you in the entry.

the dictionary is giving us two choices or two different ways to spell The Savior’s Name in Hebrew. Say what? Vowel or stress points
are discussed later in the book. (See p. 52)

    ַ‫* יְ הֹ ושֻׁ ﬠ‬Y hôwshûʿa, yeh-ho-shoo´ -ah; from 3068 and 3467; Jehovah-saved; - this means; the same as the first line- only there are two
                 e

more numbers attached to This Name. Therefore, The Name ‫ יהושע‬has two roots: one root comes from the 3068 and the other comes
from the 3467. Each of these roots represent the origin of that particular portion of the name. In other words, This Name is broken
down into two parts that become the foundation of its meaning. Roots of a name are the pillars, or strength of its meaning. Because we
are in a Hebrew dictionary, common sense would tell us that an “H” would naturally appear in front of these numbers. The “Jehovah-
saved” is representative of the two roots in question. One root number would represent the “Jehovah” and the other root number would
represent the “saved”. This “Jehovah-saved” must be proven by the two roots. NOTE: the Hebrew name here is a five letter name
also covered in its own share of vowel points. But did you notice that the vowel points are different than the first Hebrew name?

    Jehoshuä (i.e. Joshua), the Jewish leader: - Jeh – oshua or Jehoshuah or Joshua (218x) - self-explanatory

 See: BDB – 221c, 448a. comp 1954, 3442 - this means; look in the “Brown-Driver-Briggs Hebrew lexicon”, abbreviated BDB, on p.
221c. The “c” is the portion of the second column on page 221, where you will find the reference number you are looking up. You will
find these reference numbers on the outside edge of each column and the definition these numbers represent within the column in the
BDB. 448a is page 448 at the top of the first column. The little “a” represents the first portion of the first column. Now, “comp” is an
abbreviation for “compare”. This means “compare” the previous number definitions with the H1954 and the H3442 in the BDB book.

The BDB has a section dedicated to defining all abbreviations used in the front of the book. It is very important that you don’t let the
abbreviations scare you off, or frustrate you into ceasing from your labors of study. This could be very dangerous. The BDB and The
“Gesenius Lexicon” are absolutely riddled with abbreviations. The authors and scholars of these necessary tools, in order to break into
this Hebrew language with, do not communicate on the page in normal English; they speak their own language. I call it, ‘The language
of abbreviations’. Why? Because they don’t have to use as much effort in typing, and they wouldn’t have to use up as much ink (I
think). If you don’t go crazy first, you will become very skilled in seeking out the etymology of bible words, equipped in identifying
any name in Hebrew by its roots, and able to find the Hebrew origin to Greek words, including correcting errors in your own study
manuals. Bottom line, it’s an excellent skill to have in proving any matter according to scripture in the Hebrew text. The BDB Hebrew
reference numbers can also be accessed by turning to the Index at the back of the BDB book. Really simple.

Now, how do you locate the H3091 in the OT (Old Testament)? We just learned in the “Strong’s Dictionary of Bible Words” that it is
used more than 200 times and it says it comes from the name Jehoshuah or Joshua. If The Name of The Savior is of Hebrew origin, then
we most certainly should be able to find the foretelling about That Name right? (See Acts 10:43) The best place to start is to do a
search on every single time the H3091 is used in the Hebrew text. That’s right! You will be reading over 200 of them looking for
anything that remotely sounds like the foretelling of The Name of The Mashýacḥ. That’s what “studying” looks like. (That was
intended for the teenager who has a habit of eye-rolling their way through life.) If you are hungry enough to know the truth, you will
be among the few (Acts 17:11, MaṭhaṭhYahū/Matt 7:13, 14) who will go to great lengths to search it out.

                                    Below, is a scripture with the H3091 without Strong’s numbers.

ZakarYah/Zech 6:11 “Andyou shall take the silver and gold, make a crown, and set it on the head of Yehoshua/Yahūshâ the son of
Yehotsaḏaq/Yahūtsadq, the high Kahan,
                                                   Same passage in the Hebrew:


                 ‫יא ולקחת כסף וזהב ועשית עטרות ושמת בראש יהושע בן יהוצדק—הכהן הגדול‬
                            (You will find out later in the book why I picked this particular Hebrew passage)


                                                    Don’t panic, its not that scary, really.
                                           ‫( יהושׁוּע‬218x) *Ye hôwshûwʿa, yeh-ho-shoo´ -ah; or
                               ‫* ְיהֹ ושֻׁ ַﬠ‬Ye hôwshûʿa, yeh-ho-shoo´ -ah; from 3068 and 3467; Jehovah-saved;
                             Jehoshuä (i.e. Joshua), the Jewish leader: - Jeh – oshua or Jehoshuah or Joshua (218x).
                                                   See: BDB – 221c, 448a. comp 1954, 3442

The Name in the Hebrew text of ZakarYah/Zech 6:11 is a five letter name in the text (As the arrow shows above) not a six letter
name. If we are to assume that the second name is the correct match in the text, where did this other name come from with six letters?
Why is it there at all? Can vowel points be the cause? Everything has to be sought out and accounted for. We must over turn every
stone detectible in this search.

When I go online to the “Blue Letter Bible” to conduct searches on this H3091, a list of scriptures will pop up with the “Strong’s”
reference number over the name “Joshua.” To view these scriptures, I can scroll down—and this will give me access to all the
“Joshua” scriptures under the “lexicon listing” for the H3091. The lexicon listing will always list this Hebrew name as the six letter
Hebrew name- like this:
                                                                  ַ‫יְ הוֹשׁוּﬠ‬
                                                 (The vowel points are easier to see here)

   Uh-oh! This six letter Hebrew name we just learned (Notice the above arrows) was not a match according to the Hebrew text in
                ZakarYah/Zech 6:11. To add to the confusion, the “Blue Letter Bible Lexicon” gives this information:


               Variant spellings for this word: ‫( יהושוע‬Strong’s and Gesenius) ‫( יהושע‬Strong’s and Gesenius)
                                    So...which name or spelling is correct, and how do you prove it?

You may be thinking, “What is the Blue Letter Bible?” This website, abbreviated, “BLB” is an excellent study tool. Here are the
screenshots of the steps I took to look up this six letter Hebrew word.

(Fig. 1)      This is the first thing you will see when visiting the website.
                                                                                                        (http://www.blueletterbible.org/)

(Fig. 2)   This is the “Classic” view.




(Fig. 3)
                                         I prefer the previous view (fig 3). If you want to return to
                                         the previous view, just simply click the back button.
                                         When visiting this site, the “classic” view may be the first
                                         view to appear. Choose what is comfortable for you.

                                         When I wanted to look up the H3091, I entered the
                                         number in the search box under “SEARCH THE BIBLE”
                                         provided in my preferred view at the left. (Fig. 3)

                                         Notice, under the search bar, where I entered the number,
                                         is the option to choose your bible version. The little black
                                         arrow reveals a dropdown box with a list of bible
                                         versions. Click enter on your keyboard when you have
                                         entered the number, and clicked on the bible version of
                                         your choice.

(Fig. 4: part 1)                       This is what will appear after you have clicked enter.




In Fig. 4 above, the six letter name has top billing in this BLB Lexicon. This six letter name, and its English transliterated spelling, is
emphasized in all lexicons everywhere. Notice where the five letter name is in this screenshot? You will find it under “variant
spellings” leading us to believe the six letter spelling is correct. Make note of the “Root Word (Etymology)” section. That is very
important. Those two numbers (H3068) and (H3467) reveal the meaning of the name we are studying, and hints the correct spelling.
The meaning and the spelling must agree. Now, let’s scroll down and see what other info is available to us on this name.

information like this, it’s important to note that you are responsible for verifying all information that is handed to you by these lexicon
authors. Let me say this: YOU DO NOT HAVE TO BE A SCHOLAR TO SEARCH OUT TRUTH! You don’t even have to go to
law school, to learn how to dig up evidence, in order to compare false information, with information that has been verified with
witnesses. These lexicon entries can intimidate you if you let them! Moving on, let’s scroll down a little more.
                                                                                                                         Page 28 of 396


This screen shot in fig. 6, now gives us the “Concordance results” below the Gesenius entry when scrolling down further on this
number search. Let’s look at that. I have numbered each line in this entry for you.

                                                           One line at a time.

                                 Strong's Number H3091 matches the Hebrew ַ‫( יְהוֹשׁוּﬠ‬Yĕhowshuwa`),
                             2
                             which occurs 218 times in 199 verses in the Hebrew concordance of the KJV
                                                    3
                                                     Page 1 / 4 (Exo 17:9–Jos 5:2)

1
 Strong's Number H3091 matches the Hebrew ַ‫( יְהוֹשׁוּﬠ‬Yĕhowshuwa`), - this means; the six letter name is emphasized and is
telling the student that H3091 represents Yehowshua. This must be proven! (See pp. 66-67 on this spelling)

2
 which occurs 218 times in 199 verses in the Hebrew concordance of the KJV – this means; the lexicon result is leading us to
believe that the six letter name is found 218 times in the 199 verses within the BLB Lexicon. This must be proven!

3
 Page 1 / 4 (Exo 17:9–Jos 5:2) – this means; a list of scriptures are given, four pages of them, that this H3091 is found by the BLB
Lexicon.

(Fig. 6: part 3 of fig. 4)




Can you see that there is no explanation for the variant spellings? Seems the student is right back to square one huh? What does the
student do when falling prey to this Ping-Pong effect of information on two different spellings for a Hebrew name? This is what you
can do. Process of elimination is a great place to begin. A list of all the scriptures the H3091 is found in, is handed to you on a silver
platter in the BLB; four pages of them! Look for the five letter name, by clicking on every single one of those numbers in the listed
verses, highlighted in red, as seen in the above screenshot (Fig. 6). When using that search, you will encounter a problem. Every single
one of the H3091 will default back to the six letter name at the top of the lexicon, just like fig. 4 shows. This will prove that THE
LEXICON is pushing the six letter name. The search for the five letter and six letter name must be done by looking into the Hebrew
script itself in each of these verses.

If you have the Hebrew font installed on your computer, type in the six letter Hebrew spelling in the search box. When I did this in
my computer software, “TheWord”, I came up with two locations in the text: Dabarým/Deut 3:21 and Shaphatým/Judg 2:7.

(Fig. 7)
                                                 This search was done by switching from the English text to the *Westminster
                                                 Leningrad Codex as seen in fig. 7. Common sense will tell us that you cannot type in
                                                 a Hebrew word and expect results to come out of an English source. You have to pick
                                                 a Hebrew source text to query your search. Click on the white arrow at the top of the
                                                 tool bar on the BLB to open up a drop down box. This will contain a list of
                                                 translations to choose from. At the bottom, the box has a few choices with a different
                                                 colored background. Choose “WLC.” This will change the scripture verse list at the
                                                 bottom from English to Hebrew as viewed in fig. 8 below.


                                                 Count how many times in fig. 8 below, the six letter name is found in every single
                                                 one of these verses listed in the BLB. I promise you- it will not be 218 times. Count
                                                 also, how many times the five letter name is found; four pages of these scriptures on
                                                 the BLB site need to be proven. This lexicon result is saying that the H3091
                                                 MATCHES the six letter name. Do you remember clicking on the H3091 in red in
                                                 the screenshot (fig. 6) on the previous page? It defaulted to the six letter name in the
                                                 lexicon- right? Looking at the actual Hebrew text in fig. 8 below, the red arrows
                                                 show the five letter name. What is wrong with this picture? The default name is the
                                                 six letter name, Yahūshūâ. The actual name in the text is the five letter name,
                                                 Yahūshâ. WHAT? (Remember, in the beginning, “Thayer’s lexicon” had us on a
hunt for the name “Jesus.”) Wow, what a crazy ride. So far, we have discovered that the H3091 does not match the six letter name,
Yahūshūâ. In fact, the H3091 in these four verses listed in fig. 8 below, taken from the “Blue Letter Bible” site, is proven to match
the five letter spelling Yahūshâ. I personally searched out all 199 verses listed in this lexicon. If you don’t want to miss anything, you
must check all of them. Never neglect any root word numbers attached to any name search. The H3091 carries two reference numbers:
H3068 and H3467. These two numbers need to be searched out. Remember, the meaning of the name is in those numbers!

                                                                      son of Nun is the guy that led the children of Yasharʿål (Israel) over

                                                                      red (fig. 6 and fig. 10) that represents all the “Joshua’s” on this site,

five letter name is in fact, the spelling found in the actual text. All these facts must be considered when searching out The Name of
The Savior. Also, keep in mind that, the “Thayer’s Greek Lexicon” we began this study in, claims that the name “Jesus” comes from
the H3091. This claim must be proven or disproven with facts from the original text.

                                                                                                 “Strong’s” column? Why do you

Its getting weird now ain’t it? The original text tells us what the spelling is but remember, it is shrouded in vowel points. On the
                  following page, I have inserted my own personal assessment notes on this BLB H3091 search.
                                                                                                                                      Page 32 of 396


Jdg 2:7
And the people served the LORD all the days of Joshua, H3091 and all the days of the elders that outlived Joshua,
H3091 who had seen all the great works of the LORD, that he did for Israel.

                                                              Judg 2:7 in Hebrew below:

      ‫וַ ַיּﬠַבְ דוּ הָ ﬠָם אֶ ת־יְ הוָה כֹּ ל יְ מֵ י יְ הֹ ושֻׁ ַﬠ וְ כֹ ל ׀ יְ מֵ י הַ זְּקֵ נִ ים אֲ שֶׁ ר הֶ א ֱִריכוּ י ִָמים אַ ח ֲֵרי‬
                ‫יְ הֹושׁוּ ַﬠ אֲשֶׁ ר ָראוּ אֵ ת כָּל־מַ ﬠֲשֵׂ ה יְ הוָה הַ גָּדֹ ול אֲשֶׁ ר ﬠָשָׂ ה לְ יִ ְשׂ ָר ֵ ֽאל׃‬
Assessment of these results:
According to the BLB lexicon, H3091 is listed 218 times in 199 passages.
Criteria for this lexicon entry claim:
    1. The six letter Hebrew name is emphasized; six letter name is set as default for all H3091 searches; consistent with all
          dictionaries and lexicons available -     ַ‫יְ הֹ ושׁוּﬠ‬
     2. Lexicon lists three pages of scripture for H3091 at 50 passages per page. Last page lists 49 passages. Total passages: 199;
          total pages: four
     3. “The 218 times” disregards spelling in the original Hebrew text. Actual number of times the emphasized six letter name is
        found is one time in the 199 passages that were listed in the BLB lexicon. This one time is located in Judg 2:7 and includes
        the five letter spelling in the same passage. Total number of times the five letter spelling was found in the same 199 passages
        in the Hebrew text of the BLB lexicon: 217 times.
     4. The English rendering of the two names is Joshua and Jehoshua. Both Joshua and Jehoshua English renderings or
        transliteration, favors the six letter Hebrew name ‫ﬠ‬
                                                           ַ ‫יְ הֹ ושׁוּ‬/YAHUSHUA
     5. ‘Shūâ’ is favored from six letter spelling by vowel points blanketing all 199 passages when found only one time regardless of
          ‘Shâ’ ending in five letter name in the original text at 217 times.
     6. BLB does not disclose this information.

Now, remember as I said previously in this study, I had searched out the six letter name in my computer software “TheWord”. I found
two locations: Shaphatým/Judg 2:7 and Dabarým/Deut 3:21. I typed in the six letter name on BLB, and the results only showed
Shaphatým/Judg 2:7. This location lists both spellings in the same verse as we have witnessed. All the study manuals and the online
sources favor the six letter name and reiterate that it is found over 200 times. What does this mean? It means that we have spotted
errors in the lexicon! The six letter Hebrew name typed into the BLB search box is not listed 218 times. According to the Hebrew text
the five letter name is the one listed over 200 times. Does this mean that we have enough proof for the correct spelling of The
Savior’s Name? I believe it is safe to say that the spelling error has been proven in this search. So, the answer to that question is yes.
However, we still have to find the passage that foretells The Name. The foretelling of The Saviors Name lies somewhere in one of
those 217 passages. Here is the struggle in a nut shell we have been cursed with, while digging for our Savior’s Name:

     1.   We begin with the Greek name “Jesus” that has a Hebrew origin.
     2.   We discover in our study manuals that we have two names to choose from; both are spelled differently with different vowel points on each.
     3.   All study sources and online sources disagree with The Name found in the original text
     4.   All the English variables are: Jesus, Iesous, Joshua, Jehoshua, Jehoshuah, and Yehowshua. A grand total of six names to choose from.

I have yet to see an English variable in any: journal, dictionary, or recent teaching manual from scholars, or well respected authorities of any ancient
text, directly or indirectly related to the scriptures, published for worldwide distribution with this spelling, *YAHŪSHÂ. This English spelling
cannot be found in any lexicon version known to man that I am aware of. Why do you think this is?

     Well, at this point, a new student would be tempted out of frustration to either, conclude that we have many names to call The
     Savior, or just give up. But don’t you dare! There is so much to be found in our search for The Name. I have good news for you
     in your journey reading this book, “Evidence For The Name.” The good news is you will learn: where The Name of our Savior
     can be found in the Hebrew text, how to transliterate the Hebrew Name, how to prove the pronunciation of This Name, how to
     prove This Name by the root it carries, how vowel points can change a name, and best of all, how to finish out this study all by
     yourself. That is a fact. However, make note that patience and tenacity is required in this task. Because in this brief study you
     witnessed, that when digging for The Savior’s Name, the confusion increased the deeper you dug. You must understand that the
     truth is buried. It’s going to take work to uncover it. This book will help you learn how to uncover buried treasure. The
     explanation I just gave, while walking you through three different dictionaries, and the BLB, is all you need to get started. That’s
                                                                                                                         Page 33 of 396

    how simple it is to use study materials. These study manuals are just a bunch of glorified dictionaries. At the end of this book, we
    will continue to walk through this study together ladies, (and those of you who are not ladies). I am not abandoning you at this
    point. This section was meant to help you navigate your way through these study manuals, without being ignorant of the obvious.
    Certain things don’t add up in our study manuals. It is up to you to find out which lexicon results don’t agree with the original
    text. You will also learn, that root numbers attached to these names will serve as a witness, for or against what the lexicon is
    telling you. You don’t have to be a scholar, to find the foretelling of The Name of Mashýacḥ. You don’t have to be a scholar, to
    search for truth in the scriptures. You are responsible for proving what you believe though. Not the teachers. This will take effort.
    You can do this. Don’t panic baby, one line at a time. If you can’t find it one line at a time, do it one word at a time.

                                          This study will resume at the end of this book.

Transliteration is transferring the sound of a letter or character from a source language word to a target
language; using an equivalent letter or character’s sound in the target language, while preserving the original sound of
the letter as closely as humanly possible.

Translation is the communication of the meaning of a source-language text by means of an equivalent target-
language text. In other words, to translate or bridge the meaning of a word or phrase from one language into the next.



Example: Translation of Hebrew source text:               - Ṭahalým/Ps 2:11 –

                                 ‫עבדו את־יהוה ביראה וגילו ברעדה׃‬
                                   quivering in the you exult and fear in the   Yahūah -    aṭh   you serve

                               “You, serve Yahūah-‫ את‬in fear. You, rejoice in trembling/shaking.”

Bad Habit?

I would like to explain a habit I have in transliterating Hebrew letters into the English. This habit is not a crucial concern,
in my opinion, for any student to begin to pick up while reading this book. It seems, however, to stir a bit of controversy
in my circle of friends. I use the letter ‘a’ between the consonants after transliterating a name from Hebrew to English.
Below, is an example of this habit that will be noticed as you continue through each section of the book.



                            Ålahým is transliterated from this Hebrew Word: ‫ אלהים‬Ålahým



                                               ‫אל ה י ם‬
                                                                                       Start reading here
                                               M      Y       H        L      A




                                                The A is from the ‫ א‬- ålaph
                                                 The l is from the ‫ ל‬- lamad
                                            The ‘a’ is added from the habit I have
                                                  The h is from the ‫ ה‬- Ha
                                                  The y is from the ‫ י‬- yad
                                              The m is from the ‫ם‬- final mým


                            If I was to transliterate without the small ‘a’, it would read like this:

                                                           ÅLHÝM

   If one was to pronounce this word as it is written, in my opinion, it would sound the same, or reasonably close. The
addition of the small ‘a,’ is so miniscule, I feel, its just not worthy of debating. I mentioned this just in case there would be
                a question in the mind of a student who can see that there are only five characters in ‫אלהים‬.
    Yet there are six English letters in the transliteration. You will find the use of the ‘a’, in many other Hebrew words
  transliterated into English, throughout the pages of this book. I hope this explanation will prevent any confusion rather
                                                           than cause it.
                                                                                                                   Page 36 of 396




Names are different because they are not translated: they are transliterated. When names are transliterated, the original
pronunciation is to be preserved when carrying the name over into the next language. Once we begin to apply this
rule, we can more effectively grab hold of the fact that no matter what language we speak, people’s names are always the
same. Michael Jordan is Michael Jordan in every language. Jean-Claude Van Damme is Jean-Claude Van Damme in
every language. We even try our best to pronounce “Jean” as “Zjhaun”, so as to pronounce his name the way it should be.
Names don’t change. Unfortunately, this has not been the case in transliterating the Father’s Name. The Father’s Name
has been removed from almost every translation known to man (almost 7,000 times), and has been replaced with titles like
“lord” and “god.”
Because of our sins, we are captives in a world that does not respect the Name of ‫יהוה‬. Many religious sects (Catholics,
Jews, Christians) have gone through great extremes to mask the true Name of the Sovereign of the Universe. Let us begin
with a letter for letter transliteration of ‫ יהוה‬and learn what His Name really is.
And The Name Is?
“Thus you are to say to the children of Yasharʿål/Israel: ‫יהוה‬, Ålahým of your fathers has sent me to you. THIS                 IS
MY NAME FOREVER!!! AND THIS IS MY MARK TO ALL GENERATIONS!”
Shamūṭh/Exodus 3:15. The evidence is very clear: the Most High had a specified Name that could never change! It is
important to remember that I am using an Interlinear translation of the Scriptures (written in Hebrew/Aramaic and Greek),
and I am writing the Father’s Name as it appears in the Interlinear text. How do we pronounce ‫ ?יהוה‬The first letter from
the Hebrew in the Name is yd/ ‫י‬. The yd makes the ‘ya’ sound and this gives us ‘YA’. The next letter is ha/ ‫ה‬. Ha (when
it is not the first letter of a word) makes the ‘ah’ sound. Now we have ‘YAH’. So far so good! The first two letters are
extremely important because of Ṭahalým/Psalms 68:4, which triumphantly proclaim, “By His NAME YAH!” Some
translations render ‘YAH’ as ‘JAH’. There is no letter ‘j’ in Hebrew and the letter ‘j’ is only a few hundred years old. If
you look at a dictionary of Hebrew words for the word ‘JAH’, you will see the Strong’s H3050. When you turn to H3050,
you will see that ‘JAH’ in Hebrew is yd ha/ ‫יה‬, and renders a pronunciation of ‘YAH’. So, the first two letters of the
Name will give us ‘YAH’ not ‘JAH’. Keep in mind, when you say Hallelujah, despite the suffix JAH, you actually
pronounce it as Yah. As you become more familiar with studying the Scriptures, in the Hebrew text, you will also note
that Ṭahalým/Psalms 116:19, 117:2 and 118:5 all refer to the Father (poetically) as yd ha/ ‫יה‬: YAH (in the original
Hebrew text). Halal u Yah for Ṭahalým/Psalms!

numerous Proper nouns with this shortened form of H# 3068. Gesenius Lexicon; a word abbreviated from
H#3068, whence by the loss of sound at the end of Yahu, then by the omission of the unaccented ‘u’. Either of
these forms is used promiscuously at the end of proper names-Yah is used in certain customary phrases;
Ernest Klein’s Etymological Dictionary 255; shortened form of H# 3068, rendered in Greek as ‘ia’ and ‘ia’ or
‘io’ in Latin; also used in New Hebrew to form nouns from other nouns, meaning ‘a place for’ or ‘occupation
of’.

Ålahým of the Hebrews – derives from H#1933 – huah; Ernest Klein’s Etymological Dictionary 255; proper
Name of the Ålahým, probably deriving from H1933 – *huah.

The next letter of the Name causes much confusion, but since we are doing a letter for letter transliteration of the Name:

                          ‫ו‬
let us break down the uu/ (pronounced oo as in pool). In Modern Hebrew, the uu is referred to as waw or vaw, and has
been changed to make a ‘v’ or ‘w’ sound. Originally, there was no letter ‘v’ or ‘w’ in Hebrew. Since we are trying to get
the most accurate transliteration of the mighty Name of ‫יהוה‬, we must go back further to understand the history of our
own language to see where the error occurred. With a little research, you will discover that letters v, u, and w all come
from the Hebrew uu, and were originally vowel sounds. Notice the letter ‘w’. Although we pronounce it as ‘double u’, we
write it as double ‘v’. This is because the letter ‘v’ originally carried the ‘u’ sound. The ‘u’ was hard, as in “put”. Two v’s
became the way to pronounce (oo), which gave the alphabet a new letter: double u (w). When you sound out the word
‘new’, you would say ‘noo’. Notice on the following page in diagram 1 how the word ‘new’ was originally written...


Did you notice the spelling? N.E.V.V. was the way to write new, because the double u (w) sound was made by combining
v and v. When dealing with the Hebrew letter uu/‫ו‬, we have to understand that this letter makes the ‘oo’ sound (double u)
and is not an actual letter equivalent to the English ‘w’. The English alphabet derives from Latin, and the Latin V (taken
from the Greek Úpsilon υ) represented the letter U. Notice the spelling for the Institute of Massachusetts in diagram 2:
                                                                                 Page 40 of 396

Diagram 1:

             English derived from Latin, Latin derived from Greek and Greek
             traces back to Aramaic, which leads back to Hebrew. The oo sound
             was common in all of these languages.

             Translators have mistakenly rendered the uu/ ‫ ו‬as ‘w’, but it literally
             sounds out a double u (oo). This has created a huge problem! This is
             the reason why newer printed translations of the 1611 edition of the
             King James Bible brought about mass confusion. Words like Leviticus
             were originally written as Leuticus. Paul was written as Pavl. Even
             David would have been written as Daud. Observe this short quote on
             the history of printing and translating of the 1611:

             The original printing was made before English spelling was standardized, and when
             printers, as a matter of course, expanded and contracted the spelling of the same
             words in different places, so as to achieve an even column of text. They set “v” for
             initial “u” and “v”, and “u” for “u” and “v” everywhere else. They used long “ſ” for
             non-final “s”. The letter “j” occurs only after “I,” as in the final letter in a Roman
             numeral. Punctuation was relatively heavy, and differed from current practice. When
             space needed to be saved, the printers sometimes used ye for the, (replacing the
             Middle English thorn with the continental y), set ã for an, or am (in the style of
             scribe’s shorthand), and set “&” for “and.” (Wikipedia Encyclopedia)




Diagram 2:




                                                    1582 Rheims

                                    Did you notice the spelling of Paul’s name?
                                   This is because the letter v made the u sound
                                            before it made the v sound.
                                                                                                                 Page 41 of 396




The uu/ ‫ ו‬is a literal double u (oo) sound and is not equivalent to the English ‘w’. Ignoring this fact has changed the
spelling and the meaning of thousands of Hebrew words. Take note of the first three letters of Yahudah (Judah) in
Hebrew: yd ha uu/ ‫( יהו‬Ya-hoo or Yahu). The first three letters of Yarushalam (Jerusalem) in Hebrew are yd rash uu/
‫ ירו‬and render a pronunciation of Ya-roo-sha-lam. The prophet YashâYahu/Isaiah also carries yd ha uu/ ‫יהו‬.
YaramYahu/Jeremiah also carries yd ha uu ‫יהו‬. These are just a few examples to show that an error occurred with the
letter uu ‫ו‬. Please remember that the uu ‫ ו‬is pronounced as oo and has been changed to ‘v’ or ‘w’ in Modern Hebrew only.
Now, if I have not totally lost you, let us get back to the Father’s Name. We now have yd ha uu ‫יהו‬, which is always
YAHU (Ya-hoo). The final letter of the Father’s Name is ha/ ‫ה‬. The ha/ ‫ ה‬normally gives the ‘ha’ sound at the beginning
of a word. If the ha/ ‫ ה‬comes in the middle or at the end of a word, the sound is then changed to ‘ah.’ This is why ha uu
ha/ ‫ הוה‬gives HU-AH (hoo-ah) and not HUH (hoo). Now, when we put it all together, the Father’s Name is yd ha uu ha
‫יהוה‬: YAHUAH (Ya-Hoo-Ah)! There are many who argue that YAHUAH is incorrect because the vowel points do not
point to this spelling. Keep in mind that what we call Hebrew today is a mixture of Hebrew and Aramaic.


                                   Let us look at the Ancient spelling of Yahuah:      hwhy




Where are the vowel points? The Masorites invented vowel points in the Ninth Century A.D.; men created new words and
meanings with them. Now, let us look at Yahudah (Judah) and discover how this tribe carries the Name of YAHUAH.
Yahudah is written as yd ha uu dalath ha ‫( יהודה‬dalath gives the d sound). Yahudah has five Hebrew letters and
YAHUAH has four. The difference between YAHUAH/ ‫ יהוה‬and Yahudah/ ‫ יהודה‬is the dalath/ ‫ד‬. If you remove the
dalath/ ‫ ד‬from Yahudah/ ‫יהודה‬, you now have yd ha uu ha/ ‫יהוה‬: YAHU~ AH! A beautiful transliteration of the most
Set-Apart Name one could ever speak: YAHUAH! The Name of the Father is YAHUAH (English) ‫( יהוה‬Modern
Hebraic script)   hwhy   (Ancient Paleo script). (http://www.bookemon.com/book-profile/articles-of-the-hebrew-

Section 1: Chap. 4a

Hebraic words are easily broken down into primary root words. Yahudah (Judah) is broken down into two separate words:
Yah (H# 3050) and Hūd (H# 1935) – Yahūdah. YAHŪAH is broken down into two root words: Yah (H# 3050) and Hūah
(H# 1933) – Yahūah. Yahweh contains Yah (H# 3050), but there is no Hebraic use of Weh: it does not exist.

Words all change with the removal of a letter, but the general annunciation remains the same. World becomes word with
the removal of the letter l. Hope becomes hop with the removal of the letter e. Same becomes Sam with the removal of the
letter e. Yahūdah becomes Yahūah with the removal of the letter d. When we refer to the Father ‫ יהוה‬as Yahweh, we are
saying that Yahūdah becomes Yahweh with the removal of the d. (remember: Yahūah and Yahūdah have the exact same
Hebrew spelling with the exception of the letter d: ‫)יהודה… יהוה‬. This is nonsense. Yahūdah would have to be written as
Yahwdeh in order to become Yahweh with the removal of the letter d.

The Romans served a deity who was the same as Zeus, and his name was Jove (Ioue). At first glance, we would
pronounce this word as Jove in English, but Romans spoke Latin that was derived from Greek. Let us break down Jove:

J – Only 500 years old and came from the letter i, which is from the Greek Iota: (ee).
O – The Latin O is pronounced as the Greek Omicron: (pronounced ah).
                                                      
When linked together, the Iota and the Omicron - -are pronounced as ee-ah and written as Iah. Iah was the way both
Romans and Greeks pronounced Yah!

V – The Latin V was pronounced as the letter U: uu We now have ee-ah-uu (Iahu – Yahu)
E – The Latin E was taken from the Greek Eta: …making the eh sound.
In Latin (a language derived from Greek), Jove would have been pronounced ee-ah-uu-eh: Iahueh, which would later
become Iahweh (as v v became the new way to transliterate u), until finally being passed off as a Hebrew word:
Yahweh. Yahweh is Jove (Ioue), the sky god of the Romans, worshipped as Zeus/Jupiter by the Greeks.
The only Name for the Father, given by the Father, was yd ha uu ha YAHŪAH/         ‫יהוה‬.

Section 2:      Chap. 1                  Masorah and Masoretic Text
 The Name of ‫ יהוה‬has been attacked for centuries. The debates surrounding the pronunciation of This Name, originate from a single
source. This brief explanation of the Masorah is an excellent addition to this book. Without understanding the use of vowel points and
 how they came to be in a text that never had them in the first place, the student of the bible will continue to be ignorant of one of the
 most deceptive practices that has crept into every translation of the bible. As a result, this practice surrounding This Name, ‫יהוה‬, has
                                           bled into every study source available to us today.

A peculiarity of the way in which the Hebrew language was (and, like Arabic, still is) normally written is that it is written
without most vowels. For more than a thousand years, the consonants were written, but the vowels required for
pronunciation had to be supplied by the reader. This is true of the Qumran manuscripts. This "consonantal” text of the
Hebrew Bible has been regarded as fixed (not to be changed) since the first century A.D. and the Jewish people have ever
since attached great importance to its precise transmission.

The problem remains that the consonantal text frequently allows for different possible pronunciations and thus potentially
also different meanings. Knowledge of the correct pronunciation and meaning therefore had to be passed down from
generation to generation together with the written text. Around A.D. 600, Jewish scholars, the so-called Masoretes
(literally “conveyors of tradition”) finally developed a system of vowel and stress marks that also precisely fixed or
established the pronunciation and thus the meaning of the Hebrew Bible text.

The Masoretes at the same time undertook textual research of the highest quality. In addition to establishing a fixed
pronunciation and meaning, they also endeavored to secure the biblical text against mistakes in copying and, wherever
possible, to correct existing errors. To this end, in the margin of their manuscripts they added detailed notes on writing
(orthographic) variants, statistical information on the frequency of particular words, and even directions as to where they
considered a reading different from the transmitted consonantal text to be necessary. This compendium of marginal notes
is referred to as the Masorah Parva (“small Masorah”). Along with this lesser collection of notes, the Masoretes also
compiled lists of entire passages from the biblical text distinguished, for example, by a characteristic orthographic variant,
a particular sequence of words or other peculiarity. These lists, collectively referred to as the Masorah Magna (“large
Masorah”), are included at the top and the foot of the pages of the Masoretic manuscripts.

The highly meticulous work of the Masoretes gave rise to the term for the carefully copied biblical text that they made,
the “Masoretic Text.” Because of their careful work done between the 6th and 8th centuries, from that time onwards there
has been a largely uniformly transmitted version of the Hebrew Bible with only minor textual variations.

                                                                                             ʤʑ˄ʎ

      (H430), in order to prevent the repetition of the same sound, since they elsewhere
                   pronounce ‫( יְ הֹ וָה‬H3068) as ‫( אֲדֹ נָי‬H136)] (BDB entry of H3069)
                                                             Let me explain.
The H3069 ‫יהוה‬, is a different way of pronouncing the H3068 ‫ יהוה‬under vowel point rule. This invented H3069 is spoken, during a
reading, after the H136 is read and pronounced by Jews as “Elohim.” All this is done to prevent repeating or pronouncing The Name
‘Yahūah’ the same way every time, since the Jews also pronounce the H3068, ‫יהוה‬, as H136 (Adonai or Ådaný/‫)אדני‬. In other words,
the Masorites surround This Name with different vowels to cause The Name to be read or pronounced in many different ways other
than its actual pronunciation: as it is written. This is a tradition that takes precedence over the third commandment. This is sin.
                                     The Name as it is written with no points: Yahūah/      ‫יהוה‬
That’s what vowel points can do to a name. The third commandment warns us against doing this to His Name. (See p. 72)
                                                                                                            Page 51 of 396


The use of vowel points that surround The Name of The Most High, is found to be one of the most wicked practices in the
earth today. Below, is an excerpt I pulled from the article, “Origins of Adonai in The Hebrew Scriptures” by Ren Manetti.
I highly recommend downloading this article. It is an excellent read for those of you who are researching articles of study
                                for any variation of attack on The Name of Yahūah/‫יהוה‬.




               After studying the above insert, it might do us well to look at the 3rd commandment again…

                                                    Shamūṭh/Ex 20:7
 “You shall not lift up (speak) ‫ את‬The Name of ‫ יהוה‬your Ålahým to ruin it, for ‫ את יהוה‬will not acquit (pardon) anyone
                                      who lifts up (speaks) ‫ את‬His Name to ruin it.


       It doesn’t look good for those who created the vowel point system and its rules according to this command.

Section 2:    Chap. 2                     What’s a Vowel point?
Noun: any of a group of auxiliary symbols, as small lines and dots, placed above or below consonant symbols to
indicate vowels in a writing system, as that of Hebrew or Arabic, in which vowels are otherwise not written.

                                From “Articles of The Hebrew Scriptures Expanded Edition with Notes”

 The Hebrew language has been corrupted with vowel points, and though I do not use them when I teach, I wanted you to see the deception for
yourself. By learning what each vowel point does, you have to ask yourself, “What would the word sound like without the vowel point?” Here are
the ones I know… I am not 100% correct on some of the nuances of Modern Hebrew, but this should be adequate ammunition to equip you with
                                                   enough information to avoid vowel points.


 Shockingly enough, there are people who exist and firmly attest that Modern Hebrew (an Aramaic mix) cannot be read
without vowel points. The Babylonian Talmud is written without vowel points. Ancient Hebrew is written without vowel
                        points…may these 2 documents serve as a witness against these people:

 As you can see for yourself, earlier versions of Hebrew not only had no vowel points, but they still feared and reverenced
                                                      the Father’s Name:      hwhy

                                         Now, enter vowel points (Niqqud)…

                                                                           Notice the change in the 10th century script at left? The

                                                                           under it, but what does this mean? It means the Name has

                                                          Sheva

                                                             ‫ְט‬
The sheva is written as a colon under a Hebrew character and serves many functions. Sometimes, the sheva represents the
‘eh’ sound as in red, but if it is found under the second character of a word, it means that the two consonants will now join
and not carry a true root sound. Here are examples of sheva being the letter ‘e’, and causing two consonants to join.
Example 1: the letter ‘e’: H# 7126
None Vowel Pointed:   ‫ – קרב‬qarab (kaw-rab) – primitive root that means to approach or draw near.
Vowel pointed:   ‫קְ ָרב‬   – qerab (ker-rawb: H# 7128): taken from H# 7126, qerab means hostile encounter. Notice,
the sheva changed ‘qar’ to ‘qer’, the qamets was used to preserve the ‘ah’ sound. This is a definite change to the language.
Now, let’s look at sheva causing a huge change in a word.

Example 2: H# 7133
None Vowel Pointed:   ‫ – קרבן‬qaraban (kaw-ra-ban) – non vowel pointed form.
Vowel pointed:   ‫קָ ְרבָּ ן‬  – qarban (kar-bawn): taken from H# 7126, qerban means offering, or something brought
near the Slaughter place. Again, the sheva and the qamets are together, but since sheva is second, it simply joins the
rash I and the Býṭh (b) to produce ‘rb’, not a true root sound. The qamets makes sure the ‘ah’ sound stays in order to
preserve the root.

                                                   Qubuts/Shuruq

                                                            ֻ‫וּ ק‬
                                                               or


The qubuts is written as three dots flowing diagonally from a character, unless it is the Hebrew ‫( ו‬uu/uau/waw), where it
is represented with a dot in its center and referred to as shuruq. When qubuts is used, the character affixed to it makes an
‘oo’ sound as in cool, even though the ‫( ו‬uu/uau/waw) already makes this sound. Here is an example of the qubuts:
H# 5150


None Vowel Pointed:   ‫ – נחם‬nacham (naw-khawm – H# 5162) – to repent, comfort.
Vowel pointed:   ‫נִ חֻם‬   – nechum (nee-khoom). We will explore the other vowel point that turned nacham in nechum,
but notice the qubuts: cham became chum.
                                                           Hiriq

                                                              ִ‫ח‬
The hiriq is a dot under a Hebrew character. When the hiriq is used, the letter it is affixed to will make an ‘ee’ sound as in
seen. Ebrew letters that end a word do not have sounds that follow after them. Here is an example of the hiriq: H# 5150
None Vowel Pointed:   ‫ – נחם‬nacham (naw-khawm – H# 5162) – to repent, comfort.
                                                                                                               Page 55 of 396


Vowel pointed:   ‫נִ חֻם‬
                      – nechum (nee-khoom). The hiriq changed the nach sound of nachum to nee. The qubuts
changed: cham became chum.
                                                         Cholam

                                                              ‫וֹ‬
The cholam appears as a dot to the top left of a Hebrew character. When the cholam is used, the letter it is affixed to will
make an ‘o’ sound as in no. When we combine the knowledge that we have from previous vowel points and add the
cholam…we will witness deception in its truest form: BLASPHEMY AGAINST THE NAME OF THE SON. H# 3091
gives two spellings for the Name of the Son, but pronounces them both the same way. It tells us that H# 3467 (yasha) is
one of the primitive roots, but yasha is not found anywhere in the pronunciation, due to the evil of the niqqud.
Behold: H3091
None Vowel Pointed:    ‫ – יהושע‬Yahūshâ (ya-hoo-shah) – made from H# 3068 (Yahuah) and H# 3467 (yasha):
Yahuah+Yasha=Yahushâ.

*Vowel pointed:   ‫יְ הֹ ושֻׁ ַﬠ‬  – Yehoshua (ye-ho-shoo-ah). The yad has been vowel pointed with the sheva, this makes
Yahūshâ become Yehusha. The uu (waw) has been vowel pointed with the cholam, and now with the cholam and sheva:
Yahūshâ becomes Yehosha. Finally, the shan (shin) is vowel pointed with the qubuts, in addition to the sheva and the
cholam: Yahushâ becomes Yehoshua. IMPORTANT: Many believers render Yehoshua as Yahushua and admit that Yeho
only exists because of the addition of vowel points. They deny the use of the sheva and the cholam, but they keep ‘shua’,
which exists because of the qubuts. Yahūshâ has been corrupted with three different vowel points…they only remove two.
Yehoshua or Yahushua: both are blasphemy.
                                                          9. Sin

                                                             ‫שׂ‬
The sin dot is written as a dot over the left corner of the Hebrew shan. The shan naturally makes a ‘sh’ sound as in shoot.
When the sin dot is used, the shan becomes known as sin, and makes an ‘s’ sound, as is sam. Oddly enough, to preserve

the ‘sh’ sound, another dot to the shan is placed over the right corner to make it a shin:   ‫שׁ‬. Shan becomes sin? This one
needs no explanation. Here is an example of sin being added to shan: H# 7604
None Vowel Pointed:    ‫ – שאר‬sh‘ar (shaw-ar) – redundant, to swell up, remnant.
Vowel pointed:   ‫ְשׂאֹ ר‬     – se‘or (seh-ore’: H# 7603): taken from H# 7604, se‘or means yeast-cake/leaven. Notice, the
sin changed ‘sh’ to ‘s’, the sheva gives the ‘e’ sound as in red, and the cholam over the alaph changes the ‘a’ sound to ‘o’.



                                                  Dagesh/Mappiq

                                                             ‫בּ‬
The dagesh (mappiq for the ha) is a diacritic used in the Hebrew alphabet. It was added to the Hebrew orthography at the
same time as the Masoretic system of niqqud (vowel points). It takes the form of a dot placed inside a Hebrew letter and
has the effect of modifying the sound in one of two ways. The chart on the following page borrowed from Wikipedia
shows how the dagesh works in Hebrew.

There are more combinations of niqqud (vowel points) that are formed by combining the niqqud (sheva patach, sheva
segol, sheva qamets), but my purpose was to merely equip you with a basic understanding of vowel points. Now, with
these resources provided to you, you can proceed in your studies with an understanding of how certain words came to be,
and how other certain words were ‘lost in the translation.’

Section 2:     Chap. 3




This subject matter has been echoed by quite a few researchers over the years, and includes various accusations against
those entrusted to a sacred text; known to the world as the Masoretic text. What I intend to examine about the
emendations in this sub-section are: the changes that had been made, and possible ramifications this has led to;
specifically, regarding The Name of The Most High. I will include links to further your study on this matter.

First, what is an ‘emendation’ and where can they be found? Who are the ‘Sopharim’ and what role do they play in
relationship to the scriptures? I will answer these questions to lay a foundation, briefing you on the basics, then I will
explain what I have found in my research on the changes to the text itself.

       Emendation – to change, with the intent to improve upon.
       Masorah – The record of changes, or list of emendations is where the term ‘Masorah’ comes from.
       Masorites – known as ‘keepers of the scriptures’ who followed after that of the Sopherim. It is from their title, we
        receive the term Masoretic text.
       Sopharim – H5608: Sphr/‫ – ספר‬to take account of, scribe.

How do you get ‘Sopharim’ from Sphr? To make this word plural in Hebrew, or more than one scribe, add the yod/‫ י‬and
final mým/‫ ם‬to the end of the word. They would not be ‘Saphrs’ with an s at the end of the word like in English as in:
cars, boats, or toys. Instead, the word is put together like this: Sapharým/‫ספרים‬. Sapharým is the plural of Saphar.

‘The Sopherim were the authorized revisers of the Sacred Text; and, their work being completed, the Massorites were the
authorized custodians of it. Their work was to preserve it. The Masorah is called "A Fence to the Scriptures," because it
locked all words and letters in their places. It does not contain notes or comments as such, but facts and phenomena. It
records the number of times that several letters occur in the various books of the Bible; the number of words, and the
middle word; the number of verses, and the middle verse; the number of expressions and combinations of words, etc. All
this, not from a perverted ingenuity, but for the set purpose of safeguarding the Sacred Text, and preventing the loss or
misplacement of a single letter or word’. Online Source: (http://www.therain.org/appendixes/app30.html)

       The role these scribes play in relationship to the scriptures, is a seat of such sensitive responsibility, that it carries
        with it, dire consequences if taken lightly. The consequences are obvious and cuts both ways. To the reader: an
        incomplete delivery of the original message, and a skewing of the truth. To the scribe: severe judgement from The
        Most High; because the scribe took it upon himself to make changes that could effect the minds and lives of
        thousands of generations after the fact. To put it simply, applying for a job like that, is rather serious.

NacḥamYah/Neh and Âzrå/Ezr, were two scribes who have allegations against them in the matter of changing the text. It
is said that they were given authority to make changes to an original manuscript. These allegations are derived from
scribes who came after them. They believe that the text handed down to them was flawed. Consequently, the errors found
in their text, would have come from the previous scribes before them. Hence, the allegations against the two scribes or
‘Sapharým’. This is in reference to the Great Isaiah Scroll and its alleged lack of accuracy. I do recommend studying this
topic out to completion. It really is quite interesting.

The Jewish scribes who are entrusted with these manuscripts, dating back to the first century, have since made several
changes. They felt it was their responsibility to emend errors, mistakes and portions of text that needed clarifying to the
reader. As stated above, these changes have been tracked and noted by the scribes themselves, and are listed in what is
known today as the “Masorah”.

Now, that you have been briefed, I want to immediately turn your attention to appendices taken from ‘E. W. Bullinger’s
Companion Bible’, listed on the following page. I am only going into one of the subjects of emendations (Appendix 32).
The rest of them, I will leave for you to explore at your leisure.

Appendix 33: The "Eighteen Emendations" Of The Sopherim.
Appendix 34: The Readings Called Severin.

Below is a list of passages where the Masorah reveals, that the Name of The Most High was replaced. Admittedly, when
the scribe was copying from the original document; instead of transferring The Name of Yahūah/‫ יהוה‬when he saw it, he
decided to write into his copy Ådaný/‫אדני‬. (This corrected spelling of “Adonai”, has been transliterated without the
influence of vowel points.) Why the scribe would deem it necessary to move on the text in such a radical way, is
troublesome; even to the Orthodox Jew who stumbles upon these ‘Emendations of the Sopherim’.

The list from “Bullinger’s Companion Bible”, is not accurate. There is also debate over the official list given from the
“Ginsburg Edition” “Masorah” that follows as well.

                                     This Is Appendix 32 From “The Companion Bible”.

“Out of extreme (but mistaken) reverence for the Ineffable Name “Jehovah”, the ancient custodians of the Sacred Text
substituted in many places “Adonai” (see Appendix 4. viii. 2). These, in the Authorized Version and Revised Version, are all
printed “Lord”. In all these places we have printed it “LORD”, marking the word with an asterisk in addition to the note in
the margin, to inform the reader of the fact.”

Gen 18:3, 27, 30, 32; 19:18, 20:4. Ex 4:10, 13, 5:22; 15:17, 34:9, Num 14:17, Joshua 7:8 Judg 6:15, 13:8. 1 Kings 3:10, 15;

To these may be added the following, where “Elohim” was treated in the same way: 2 Sam 5:19-25, 6:9-17, where the
Authorized Version has “LORD.” 1 Chr 13:12, 14:10, 11, 14, 16, 16:1, Psa 14:1, 2, 5, 53:1, 2, 4, 5, where in Authorized
Version and Revised Version it still appears as “God”. It is printed “GOD” in the Companion Bible.

Below, is the official list given in the Masorah ‘Ginsburg’s Edition’ where Yahūah/‫ יהוה‬was replaced with Ådaný/‫אדני‬.

What ramifications could this cause? My assessment of such emendations is this; it is stated over and over again, that the
scribes were particularly meticulous in guarding every word and letter in the manuscript they were entrusted with. This
was to ensure that not a single letter would fall from the text. The scribes are praised and noted for this badge of the
highest honor in their field. With that said, I would like to ask the ‘Daddy’ of all questions, if I may. What on earth would
possess the scribe, who has been entrusted with a sacred text, to deliberately remove four letters from the text, and replace
those four letters with a different set of letters, 134 times? Remember the job description: “ensure that not a single letter,
or word, falls from the text.” Lock it in place! Also, recall the definition of “emendation” which is, “The intent to improve
upon”.

Now, I may not be the sharpest tool in the shed, but I promise you, I’m not the dullest knife in the kitchen drawer either. I
know a smoking gun when I see one. And again, I ask another question, what makes us think that these “scribes” haven’t
done more changes than what they are revealing in the Masorah? The ramifications are colossal. Already, I can see
through this artificial cloak; of honor and trust, that the world is supposed to rest in, without question. They admit to
violating the primary objective in their job description. That alone, exposes the character of the scribe entrusted to a text
as important as this one. Since this knowledge has been brought to my attention, I often wonder how deep this rabbit hole
really goes. However, I cannot allow my heart to fall prey to doubt and fear because of what I cannot prove. We are faced
with the most difficult challenges in these last days. The information given to us is fragmented at best. With obstacles so
monumental, we find ourselves scaling a landslide; leaving us in the most humbling of positions. The wisest choice left is
to seek His face, pressing in with all our heart. We can study and learn to prove matters in the Ṭūrah all day long, but
when all is said and done, in the midst of all the missing pieces; only those who hunger and thirst for Righteousness, and
doing His Commands will be given the secrets of His Reign. (Dabarým/Deut 6:25, 7:9-13, 8:3, 11:22, 13:3-4, 15:5, 16:20, 24:13, 28:15;
MaṭhaṭhYahū/Matt 5:6, 19, 7:21-24, 13:1-52; Luke 8:10-21, 11:28; Mark 4:20; Shamūʿål Býṭh/2Sam 8:15; Ṭahalým/Ps 4:5, 44:21, 111:1-10;
Yahūʿål/Joel 2:11; Danýʿål/Dan 2:47; Cḥazūn/Rev 7:16)


In order to do Righteousness, we first must find out what Yahūah declares is Righteousness. This is a study all in itself.
Uncovering the truth about what He said about His Name is a good place to start. Yes, I am suspicious of these
shenanigans regarding the removal of The Name. How many strokes of the pen does it take to remove The Name of ‫יהוה‬
from the ancient text? The world may never know.

It is important to note, that Yahūah allowed this text to be placed in the hands of the Gentiles (Ashkenazim). This
important text among others that were destroyed, used to be in the hands of the house of Yasharʿål and Yahūdah. They
have been exiled from the land and were put on ships during the 16th and 18th centuries; forced into slavery to serve their
enemies. Why? Because they refused to serve Yahūah. This was their punishment for their treachery against the Right-
Rulings of Yahūah. They were made to be slaves to the entire world. We, who are coming into this knowledge now
understand, that this text has been removed from Yasharʿål, because they were seen by Yahūah as untrustworthy to bear
His Name or His Laws; more than the heathen. This text, contains the family accounts of those slaves who were exiled. It
is their heritage. As controversial as this statement is, and quite offensive I am sure, all the nations are now put under a
frightening reality. Understanding of this text can be obtained through The Voice of Yahūah only (Åmūs/Amos 8:11-
12;YashâYahū/Isa 8:16-17) This forces the hand and heart of every single individual to seek Him directly. Not through a
man, a voice behind a pulpit, or in the land of Yasharʿål (Israel). What did Yahūah already say? What is the message in
the text that He desires us to hear that His own people refused? Without this “pressing in” that is required of us, we will
remain ignorant and ensnared by our own deceptive hearts. Consequently, this will bring His Wrath against those who
refuse to inquire of Him (TsaphanYah/Zeph 1:1-7).

Section 2: Chap 4

                            -The Jews claim that… this Name is the “Un-Utterable Name”-

One of the maladies of modern Judaism is the strict prohibition against uttering The Name of the Creator. The modern
rabbinic law code Mishnah Berurah explains:

                        It is forbidden to read the glorious and terrible Name as it is written, as the
                      Sages said, “He that pronounces The Name as it is written has no portion in the
                   World to come”. Therefore it must be read as if it were written Ådaný /‫( אדני‬Adonai)
                    (Mishnah Berurah 5:2) Online Source: “The Ban on the Divine Name” pdf- by Nehemia Gordon


                                -The Jews claim that… “The Creator has many Names”-

“I have often heard people refer to the Judeo-Christian God as “The Nameless God” to contrast our God with the ancient
pagan gods. I always found this odd, because Judaism clearly recognizes the existence of a Name for God; in fact, we
have many Names for God.” Some people render the four-letter Name as “Jehovah,” but this pronunciation is
particularly unlikely. The word “Jehovah” comes from the fact that ancient Jewish texts used to put the vowels of The
Name “Adonai” (the usual substitute for YHVH) under the consonants of YHVH to remind people not to pronounce YHVH
as written. A sixteenth century German Christian scribe, while transliterating the Bible into Latin for the Pope, wrote The
Name out as it appeared in his texts, with the consonants of YHVH and the vowels of Adonai, and came up with the
word JeHoVaH (“J” is pronounced “Y” in German), and The Name stuck.”

                                                     The Jews claim that …

  Nothing in the Torah prohibits a person from pronouncing The Name of God. Indeed, it is evident from scripture that
  God’s Name was pronounced routinely. Many common Hebrew Names contain “Yah” or “Yahu,” part of God’s four-
                    letter Name. The Name was pronounced as part of daily services in the Temple.

   The Mishnah confirms that there was no prohibition against pronouncing The Name in ancient times. In fact, the
 Mishnah recommends using God’s Name as a routine greeting to a fellow Jew. Berakhot 9:5. However, by the time of
the Talmud (Babylonian Talmud), it was a custom to use substitute Names for God. Some rabbis asserted that a person
 who pronounces YHVH according to its letters (instead of using a substitute) has no place in the World to Come, and
  should be put to death. Instead of pronouncing the four-letter Name, we usually substitute The Name “Adonai,” or
                                        simply say “Ha-Shem” (lit. The Name).

 If the Creator of all things makes a statement of any kind on any matter, especially concerning His Own Name, would it not be more
                                     trustworthy of a saying than any opinion, or tradition of man?

Section 2: Chap 4a                           The Jewish Tradition
                    Oral Torah: The Talmud

                    In addition to the Written Scriptures we have an “Oral Torah,” a tradition explaining what the
                    scriptures mean and how to interpret them and apply the Laws. Orthodox Jews believe G-d taught
                    the Oral Torah to Moses, and he taught it to others, down to the present day. This tradition was
                    maintained only in oral form until about the second century C.E., when the oral law was compiled
                    and written down in a document called the “Mishnah.”

                  Over the next few centuries, additional commentaries elaborating on the Mishnah were written
down in Jerusalem and Babylon. These additional commentaries are known as the Gemara. The Gemara and the
Mishnah together are known as the Talmud. This was completed in the 5th century C.E.

There are actually two Talmud’s: the Jerusalem Talmud and the Babylonian Talmud. The Babylonian Talmud is more
comprehensive, and is the one most people mean if they just say “the Talmud” without specifying which one.

The Talmud is not easy to read. It reminds me of someone else’s class notes for a college lecture you never attended.
There are often gaps in the reasoning where it is assumed that you already know what they are talking about, and
concepts are often expressed in a sort of shorthand. Biblical verses that support a teaching are often referenced by only
two or three words. The Talmud preserves a variety of views on every issue, and does not always clearly identify which
view is the accepted one. (http://www.jewfaq.org/torah.htm#Talmud)

                                                     In conclusion …

GD (God) -   ‫גד‬                                                                                  Ådaný - ‫( אדני‬Adonai)

Assuming these (names or titles) are a reasonable alternative, the Jews are under the belief that these titles reference the
Creator without offence to Him, according to their written code (Mishnah Berurah 5:2). They believe they are sufficient to
use in place of His actual Name, ‫( יהוה‬Yahūah). They claim this practice will help avoid the risk of erasing or defacing His
  Name in spite of the 3rd commandment spoken of by Yahūah in the Ṭūrah. It is this tradition that should raise concern
                                      about the vowel point system. (review pp. 52-56)

Section 2: Chap 5                        The Name
In this section, the corrupted forms of Hebrew names found in this book have been listed. These names at one time,
included the Ya or Yahū portion of The Name ‫יהוה‬. The list begins with the name of Yashūâ or Yeshūâ. I will begin with
this name first; because it is said to be The Name of Mashýacḥ. With a little research the confusion that surrounds this
Yiddish form of The Name of Mashýacḥ is clearly exposed. Errors in the “Strong’s Dictionary of Bible Words” and the
“Brown Driver Briggs Hebrew and English Lexicon” are also exposed. This is a lesson on how to identify errors in
Hebrew names by the roots they carry. This section gives a step by step look at how The Name of Yahūshâ ended up with
the “shūâ/‫ ”שוע‬suffix and how many other names became corrupted as well.

Page Navigation:

The corrupted/Yiddish name found in the Hebrew text is listed in yellow to the far left of the page. Its corresponding
reference number and corrected Hebrew spelling found in the “Brown Driver Briggs Hebrew/English Lexicon” follows to
the right. An address is listed above each Yiddish name for your convenience. These names are found in various scriptures
throughout this book. The page numbers where these names are found are also listed to the right of the scripture address.
Since some of the information found in our study materials is misleading, I have made the necessary corrections for you to
view and research on your own. Any name found with a line through it is the Yiddish/incorrect form. It is important to
note the missing Hebrew characters, and additional Hebrew characters, that have been added to these names because of
vowel points. Hence the term: corrupted. A transliteration table has been inserted into each corrupted name section.

After the first Yiddish name listed, lesson notes have been added. These notes will help explain errors and uncover the
deception surrounding many false names leading us away from The Name of Yahūshâ. After a brief narrative, the list of
corrupted names resume on page 68.




                            ‫נראשית‬

   And to Shaṭh, he also brought forth a son, and he called ‫ את‬his name Anūsh. At that time, men [began to]
                                  corruptly call(ed) on The Name of hwhy.
     (With further study, you will find how the word “corruptly” was overlooked in the translation. Look at “began” in Hebrew)

  The first corrupted name is Yeshūâ. After digesting the narrative that follows the transliteration table, you should be able to better
                           understand how the roots of these names prove the corruption evident in them.

        1.    ‫ ישוע‬Yeshua (H-3442): he will save? Strong’s links the root of Yeshua back to H-3091: proven to be
              Yahusha. This would make Yeshua a form of the Name of Mashýacḥ. H-3091 reveals that the primary roots for
              Yahusha are H-3068 – Yahuah, and H-3467 – yasha: the root for Yeshua is not found in H-3091, because it is a
              shortened form that only came to be because of captivity. This is why finding a Hebraic origin of Yeshua is
              impossible. The Ernest Klein Etymological Dictionary of the Hebrew language does not list Yeshua as a Hebrew
              word. Etymology: Brown Driver Briggs (BDB) pg. 221c…Yeshua came to be associated with H-3467 – yasha.
              Page 1096b reveals that Yeshua is a proper, masculine noun – This section of the BDB is 100% Aramaic. Yeshua
              as a name was only used during and after Babylonian captivity, when Yasharʿål learned the language of the
              Chaldeans ‫דניאל‬/Daniel 1:1-4.

        2.    ‫שוע‬          shua (H-7768): to be free, but only reflectively, to cry or halloo for help.


        3.    ‫ישוע‬    Yeshua (H-3443): Aramaic of H-3442
        4.    ‫ישועה‬   yashu`ah (H-3444): feminine passive participle of H-3467. Used abstractly (existing in thought or as
           an idea but not having a physical or concrete existence) for deliverance, salvation, aid, and saving. Etymology
           reveals that yashu`ah is the collateral form of H-8668 – tashu`ah.
        5. ‫תישועה‬      tashu`ah (H-8668): from H-7768 (shua) in the sense of H-3467 (sha).

                                             -The Morph From Yahusha to Jesus-
                                              From Hebrew to Greek to Aramaic

1. Yahusha has a spelling of yad ha uu shan ayn: [vwhy.This is the true Hebrew spelling.
2. During Babylonian captivity, [vwhy.was changed to yad shan uu ayn: ‫ –ישוע‬Yeshua (Aramaic).
3. As the Aramaic language (now called Modern Hebrew) was translated into Greek, certain letters and sounds did not
exist in the Greek, so they had to do the best transliteration to preserve the sound. Not the sound of [vwhy,but the
sound of the name given in slavery: Yeshua.
4. The Greek Iota (Ιι) derived from the Hebrew yad (‫ )י‬and made an ‘ee’ sound. To preserve the sound of ‘eh’ as in
Ye-shua, the Greeks used the ‘eta’ (Ηη): Yeshua (‫ = )ישוע‬Ιη-           ‫(שוע‬Ieshua). This is pronounced ee-eh-shoo-ah (Ie-
shua).
5. The Greeks did not possess a ‘sh’ sound, like the Hebrew shan (‫ )ש‬so the sigma (σς) reigned in its place: Yeshua
(‫ = )ישוע‬Ιησ- ‫(וע‬Ies-ua). This is pronounced ee-eh-soo-ah (Ies-ua).
6. The Greeks combined their omicron (Οο) and upsilon (Υυ) to make the uu sound found in the Hebrew uu (‫)ו‬:
Yeshua (‫ = )ישוע‬Ιησου- ‫(ע‬Iesou-ah). This is pronounced ee-eh-soo-ah (Iesou-ah).
7. The sound of the ayn (‫ )ע‬is not found in the Greek language, so the ayn was replaced with the final sigma (ς) to
represent masculinity: Yeshua (‫ = )ישוע‬Ιησους. Pronounced as ee-ehsooce, (G# 2424) this transliterated form of
Yeshua continued to morph.
8. Yeshua=Iesous: The crossover from Greek to Latin was smooth. The Iota remained, but the Latin language used the
letter Vv to represent the uu sound: Yeshua (‫ = )ישוע‬Iesous (Ιησους) = Ιesvs, but wait, still morphing.



9. Yeshua=Iesous=Iesvs: Latin to English was nasty. As the letter Jj came into existence from the Iota (the letter Ii),
the letter u (from the upsilon) was used opposed to v, although v made the u sound: Yeshua = Iesous = Iesvs = Jesus…
                                                                                                                           Page 65 of 396

10. Jesus: they cried out. Jesus, the anti-Mashýacḥ is nothing more than a gross transliteration of Yeshua, which was
given in slavery to blaspheme the true Name of Yahusha/[vwhy.When the Hebrews disobeyed Yahuah/ hwhy,He sent
them into Babylonian captivity, where His Name was corrupted and changed to Yeshua as an insult. In 2012, still in
Babylonian captivity, Yeshua has been given a new Yiddish form (Jesus), but still carries the overall purpose: to remove
His Name from our heritage and keep our identity hidden. Yeshua has followed us from old Babylon to new Babylon:
Yeshua, Iesous, Iesvs, Iesus, Iesu, Y’shua, Jesus, and Hesus…all the exact same name.
Who Is Yeshua? Jesus Christ.

                                         Explaining Shua vs. Sha suffix on the name
                  Online Source: “Articles of The Hebrew Scriptures- Expanded Edition with Notes” Shua vs. Sha pp. 46-49
                         (http://www.bookemon.com/book-profile/articles-of-the-hebrew-scriptures/488643)

There is a major problem with any of the shua endings of the Savior’s Name. Shua (H-7769) is a term that means to
scream or cry out. Although many feel that shua somehow means salvation; it does not. Sha (H-3467) is a primitive root
(written as Yasha), and is the masculine form of shua. Sha means to make free, deliverer or Savior. Shua and Sha are
truly enemies! Notice the names Al-yasha (Elisha the Prophet) and Al-yashua (Elishua son of David). Elisha’s name
means, “Alahym is Savior,” while Elishua means “Alahym of supplication.” As you can easily see, there are huge
differences between shua and sha. Although the Strong’s Concordance lists sha as yasha, it is found throughout Scripture
as an individual word for salvation. Shmuʿål Býth/II Samuel 22:3 makes frequent use of the sha root:


        ‫אלהי צורי אחסה־בו מגני וקרן ישעי משגבי ומנוסי משעי מחמס תשעני׃‬
             My Mighty One is my Rock, I take refuge in Him, He is my shield and the strength of my salvation
            (yasha). My High Tower and my refuge, my Savior (masha), from violence you do save (tasha) me.


Dabarým/Deuteronomy 33:29 uses the sha root alone for salvation, opposed to yasha:

   ‫אשריך ישראל מי כמוך עם נושע ביהוה מגן עזרך ואשר־חרב גאותך ויכחשו איביך לך‬
                            ‫ואתה על־במותימו תדרך׃ ס‬
Favored are you Yasharʿål/Israel! Who is like you? A people saved (sha) by hwhythe shield of your help, and He who is
the sword of your excellency! And your enemies are subdued for you, and you tread down their high places.

There are hundreds of scriptures showing H# 3467 (sha) stands as an individual word. There was only One Name
given by the Father for Him and the Son. Only one Name given under heaven by which we can be saved (Acts 4:12). I
cannot stress this enough: we must know the One Name, and we must find the use of that One Name in Scripture! At this
point, we can easily break down and discard any of the names for YAHUSHA that are not yd ha uu shan ayn ‫יהושע‬, or
that end with the shua suffix. Let us look at a list of ‘shua’ names that try but fall very short of        ‫יהושע‬/YAHŪSHA.

YAHŪSHA (‫ )יהושע‬vs. Yeshua (‫)ישוע‬
Yeshua (the Aramaic Y’shua) is the alleged Jewish Messiah and can only be a real word in Modern Hebrew by way of
Jewish influence of the language. Where does the Jewish Yeshua come from? Since we know the spelling of the
Mashýacḥ’s Name is yd ha uu shan ayn ‫יהושע‬, what is the Hebrew spelling of Yeshua? The spelling of Yeshua is yd
shan uu ayn ‫ ישוע‬and is pronounced Ya-shua. Yashua/Yeshua does not contain the Yahu                     ‫ יהו‬portion of the Father’s
                                                                                                          Page 66 of 396

Name (Yahūcḥanan/Jn 5:43). Yashua (H-3442) only appears in the Hebrew text 29 times. The definition posed to us by
H-3442 is ‘he will save,’ but I have already shown that the shua suffix does not mean salvation: it means to cry. The
actual definition for Yashua/Yeshua is ‘he cries.’ The King James Bible renders Yashua/Yeshua as Jeshua and there is no
reference in any of the Hebrew texts that this name was ever associated with Mashýacḥ.
The Jews pronounce ‫ ישוע‬as Yeshua because, with their vowel pointed system, they assign an ‘e’ behind the yd to avoid
the repetition of ‘Ya’. This in turn renders Ye opposed to Ya. Yashua/Yeshua came into existence after the Hebrews
returned from captivity in Babylon, and obviously, the language had undergone a few changes. Âzarå/Ezra 2:1-2
introduced us to the name Yashua/Yeshua for the first time. Âzarå/Ezra 3:2 shows that Yahusha/Joshua the son of
Yahutzdak’s name was now written and pronounced as Yashua/Yeshua. Though the pronunciation and written
characters of Yahusha (Joshua’s Hebrew name) changed to Yashua/Yeshua during captivity by men, his name was
given in its pure form (YAHŪSHA) when the prophesy was foretold in ZakarYah/Zachariah 6: NO PROPHESY
OF THE MASHÝACḤ EVER INCLUDED THE BABYLONIAN SPELLING OF Yashua/Yeshua. There is no
reason for us to take the name Yashua/Yeshua and apply it to anything dealing with YAHŪSHA.

YAHŪSHA (‫ )יהושע‬vs. Yahshua (‫)יהשוע‬
Some refer to the Jewish Yashua/Yeshua as Yah-shua. Yahshua is spelled yd ha shan uu ayn ‫יהושע‬. The implication
made here is that the Jewish Yashua/Yeshua should be pronounced as YAHshua because of the yd ‫י‬, but the yd only
makes the ‘Ya’ sound. We would need to apply ha‫ ה‬to get ‫‘ יה‬YAH’. Yahshua does not contain the Yahu ‫ יהו‬portion
of the Father’s Name (Yahūcḥanan/John 5:43). The spelling of Yahshua ‫ יהשוע‬is not found anywhere in
Scripture and does not exist in any Hebrew literature.

Every letter of the Hebrew language is essential for giving words of life. Hebrew is a living language. When we
breakdown the weird spelling of Yahshua, ha   ‫ ה‬and shan ‫ ש‬are back to back: ‫( הש‬Hsh). In Hebrew, two consonants
together would give a full sound. Ha and the shan ‫ הש‬would make hash, so at best, ‫ – יהשוע‬Yahshua – would be Ya-
hash-oo-ah (Yahashua). We are now left with another unknown word in Hebrew. You have already seen from the
scripture in ZakarYah/Zachariah 6:11-12, the Savior’s Name is YAHUSHA (‫)יהושע‬. Any other name must be found in
SCRIPTURE, and must be proven to be about Mashýacḥ. It is highly possible that Yahshua has been mistakenly
transliterated as Yashu’ah. Yashu’ah is the feminine passive Hebrew word for deliverance (H-3444), but does not contain
the Name of Mashýacḥ and never referred to Him in Scripture. Yahshua is not a real word: it is a wicked hybrid that
blasphemes the Name of the Savior.

YAHŪSHA (‫ )יהושע‬vs. Yahushua (‫)יהושוע‬
It is common knowledge that Joshua in Hebrew was spelled the same way as Mashýacḥ: YAHŪSHA ‫יהושע‬. The
problem is that the transliterations for Joshua have rendered many different spellings. This has brought about mass
confusion to the Name. If the Hebrew spelling of Joshua’s and the Savior’s Name were spelled the same way, and we
have different spellings of that name: how do we know which name to use? I urge all of you to learn the Scripture in
ZakarYah/Zachariah 6:11-12. This is the only scripture that gives us the exact Name of the coming Mashýacḥ:

YAHŪSHÂ (‫)יהושע‬. YAHUSHÂ would carry the same Name as Yahūshâ/Joshua the High Priest, and not
Yahūshâ/Joshua the son of Nun. If Joshua the son of Nun’s name was changed 10,000 times: it is of no consequence for
the Name of YAHŪSHÂ. In order for YAHŪAH not to lie: YAHŪSHÂ’s Name could not have changed!

*Before we go any further, I would like to address the use of the name *Yahoshua. Ya-HO-shua is a word that has been
invented by combining Yashua and ‘hovah’. Remember, ‘hovah’ (H-1943) means mischief/ruin and shua (H-7769) means
to cry out. Yahoshua (the eternal ho cries) not only falls short of being the Name: it is demonic and evil.
                                                                                                           Page 67 of 396

Strong’s H-3091 lists Yahushua as one of the many spellings of Joshua the son of Nun. Let’s look at the history of Joshua.
Joshua in Hebrew was originally Hūshâ/Hosea ‫הושע‬. Hūsha was changed to Yahūshâ ‫ יהושע‬by Mashah/Moses
(B-mdbar/Numbers 13:16). Later, after Babylonian captivity, the Name Joshua changed to Yeshua/Yashua. When
YAHUAH Himself told His Son’s Name, He used the precaptivity form, YAHŪSHÂ ‫יהושע‬, and not the post- captivity
Yeshua/Yashua ‫( ישוע‬ZakarYah/Zachariah 6:11-12). What are we to make of this fourth spelling of Joshua, Yahushua?
Written as yd ha uu shan uu ayn ‫יהושוע‬, Yahushua is one of the primary names used for the Savior by many ‘Hebrew’
followers. Yahushua does carry the first three letters of YAHŪAH with yd ha uu ‫( יהו‬Yahu). If we don’t learn how to
read the Scriptures in context, we will continue to be in a stage of confusion. For the record: Joshua’s name was never
Yahushua! Yahushua was a poetic element (as you will discover) that had to do with crying out or complaining (shua).
Yahushua literally means “Yah of supplications!” Yahushua occurs two times in scripture. In Dabarým/Deuteronomy
3:21, Mashah/Moses called Joshua Yahushua. As Mashah/Moses is speaking all the wonders of YAHŪAH to
Yashar’ål/Israel, he uses Yahushua. Verses 23-25 show how Mashah/Moses was pleading (crying out) to YAHŪAH to
cross over the Yardan/Jordan. He was using the ‘shua’ in his story to explain his sad demeanor: he was denied passage.
As YAHŪAH began to scold Mashah/Moses, in verse 26-27, what did YAHŪAH Himself call Joshua in verse 28?
YAHŪAH firmly re-asserted the masculine form of the name, Yahūshâ ‫יהושע‬, and never referred to Joshua as
Yahushua ‫יהושוע‬. YAHŪAH never used the word ‫ יהושוע‬ANYWHERE in scripture!

The second place we find Yahushua is in Shaphatým/Judges 2:7, which reads, “And the people served YAHŪAH all the
days of Yahūshâ ‫יהושע‬, and all the days of the elders who outlived Yahushua ‫יהושוע‬, who had seen all the great
works of YAHŪAH.” What a confusing verse! Yahūshâ and Yahushua are side by side in this verse; but how can this be?
In verse 4, the messenger of YAHŪAH has given Yashar’ål/Israel some very bad news: the people began to weep. In
verse 6, Joshua is once again referred to as Yahūsha. In verse 8, Yahūsha ben Nūn (Joshua son of Nun) died. When
Yahushua was used in verse 7, we have to read it in context. “And the people served YAHUAH all the days of Yahūshâ
(Joshua son of Nun) and the elders that outlived Yahushua,” Joshua had died and people were sad and crying. This verse
is yet again referring to crying out, and not the Name of the Mashýacḥ. Yahushua was used for Joshua son of Nun’s name
in two instances: both dealing with crying and/or pleading. Yahushua has absolutely no reference in the Scriptures to the
Mashýacḥ.

It is also imperative, that the student studying these roots keep in mind that all these lexicon authors are anchored to the
vowel point system throughout each definition of every entry recorded in their publication. It seems that the H1933 is the
more favorable root for “hu-ah” in Ya-hūah. It is definitely worth considering that the BDB lexicon is in error here.

Section 2: Chap 6              Yahusha: The Name of The Branch




“The scriptures foretold of a Branch of hwhy (Yahūah) that would spring forth and do amazing works. Many have said
this branch is David. Some say it was the church. Some say it was Joshua. The scriptures are very clear in regards to the
Branch…. [fwhy(Yahūshâ)”

                   Who has ascended up into heaven, or descended? Who has gathered the wind in His fists? Who has
bound the waters in a garment? Who has established all the ends of the earth? What is His Name, and what is His Son’s
Name, if you know it?

This section will help explain evidence that clearly foretells The Name of The Savior found in ZakarYah/Zech 6:11-12. In
  the notes on the following page, the Paleo script is used for The Fathers Name hwhy, and Name of The Son [fwhy.
 These are notes for the advanced student of the Hebrew text. If you don’t know how to identify the Paleo Hebrew script
words, don’t panic! Hebrew reference numbers are labeled with each word to help you along. With careful study, and use
            of study aids supplied within this book, even the beginner can easily see The Name of The Branch.

‫יהושע‬/Yahūshâ: The foretelling of Mashýacḥ
Hwhyforetold what His Son’s Name would be. ZakarYah/Zechariah 6:11-12 reads, “And you shall take the silver and
gold, and make a crown, and set it upon the head of Yahūshâ, the son of *Yahūtzdak (Yahūtzdak means hwhyis Righteous)
the high Kahan (priest). And speak to him, saying, Thus speaketh hwhy tsabʿåŭṭh, saying, Behold the man whose Name
is The BRANCH! From His place, He shall branch out and build the Hýkal (Temple) of hwhy.” As we can see in this
chapter, ‫( יהושע‬remember: this is the original spelling from the Interlinear Hebrew text) was the High Kahan (priest) who
would build the Hýkal of hwhy. This scripture indeed speaks of Mashýacḥ, and even gives His Name as the Branch: yd ha
uu shan ayn ‫יהושע‬. The High Kahan in ZakarYah/Zechariah foreshadowed the coming Mashýacḥ, and bore the same
exact Name. What was the High Kahan’s Name? ‫יהושע‬/Yahūshâ!

*Yahūtzdak (See pp. 30, 76, 305, 370)

                         We can now do a letter for letter transliteration of the Son’s Name according to the way it was
                         written: ‫יהושע‬. We know that the first three letters of Mashýacḥ’s Name will be pronounced as
                         YAHŪ because of the yd ha uu ‫יהו‬. As you can see, the Father’s Name is already evident in the
Son. The fourth letter is the shan ‫ ש‬which gives us the “sh” sound. Now we have YAHŪSH (Ya-hoosh). The final
Hebrew letter is the ayn ‫ע‬. The ayn ‫ ע‬is pronounced as the letter ‘a’ in Yah. So this gives us YA-HŪ-SHA (Ya-hoo-
shah`). Yd ha uu shan ayn ‫ יהושע‬is the only way the Saviors Name is spelled. Some translations have rendered the High
Kahan as Joshua or Yahushua. It is important to note that Joshua is not a true name, but a name implemented by those
who wish to conceal the truth of hwhyby changing names and meanings. In Dabarým/Deuteronomy 32:44 and
B’madbar/Numbers 13:8, we can read of the original name of Joshua the son of Nūn: Hoshea or Hosea (‫הושע‬, the same
as the Naby`a Hosea). Hoshea has a Hebrew spelling of ha uu shan ayn ‫ הושע‬and is pronounced Hu-sha (hoo-shah).
Hūsha (Hosea) is found 11 times in the Hebrew text, and means Savior or Deliverer. In verse 16 of B’madbar/Numbers
chapter 13, Mashah/Moses changed the name of Hūsha (original name of Joshua) to Yahushâ (new name of Joshua).
Mashah/Moses added the Hebrew letter yd ‫ י‬to ha uu shan ayn ‫( הושע‬Hūsha) and called the new name yd ha uu shan
ayn ‫( יהושע‬Yahūshâ), which is to say, “Yah is Deliverer/Savior!”

Given the various Hebrew spellings of the original name of Joshua, and the fact that there were four men that bore the
same name as the coming Mashýacḥ: we must remember that the prophesy was concerning the Yahūshâ (Joshua) in
ZakarYah/Zachariah 6. Hwhysaid the Mashýacḥ would have the same name as Yahūshâ the son of Yahūtzdak, not
Yahūshâ the son of Nūn (whose name was later shortened to Yeshua/Joshua). Yahūshâ the Kahan, son of Yahūtzdak
(hwhyis Righteous), was crowned and named the Branch who would build the Hýkal (Temple). YAHŪSHÂ is the Name
of Ha Mashýacḥ!

Section 2: Chap 7                            The Name Revealed
                                                Cepher Publishing Group

The Name is being revealed among the Christian communities through the "‫ את‬Cepher”, most recently published in 2014.
 The "‫ את‬Cepher”, second edition; is a Bible translation that now transliterates the Father’s Name, and The Name of His
Son into the English as; “YAHUAH” and “YAHUSHA HAMACHIACH”. During the fifth year of writing “Evidence for
   The Name”, this new Bible translation was brought to my attention. The following paragraphs briefly explain how
  Stephen Pidgeon, founder of Cepher Publishing Group, came to discover that The Name of The Most High has been
                                             hidden with replacement titles.

“Stephen began to read not only the books designated as the Apocrypha, but also other books such as those found in the
Dead Sea Scrolls. Early in 2002, he began to compile his own “Bible” for personal use, which also included the Book of
Jubilees and the Book of Enoch. In 2006, Stephen and one of his Bible Study partners, Brad Huckins, were sharing
information about various editions of the Bible and discussing the accuracy of these translations when they discovered a
similar interest in uncovering the essential truth of the scriptures. Late in 2008, Stephen first suggested that the public
domain copy of the King James Bible should be modified to minimize the archaic English. This resulted in the first digital
file serving as a baseline for the scriptures in the book we now call the ‫ את‬CEPHER.

There were notorious errors in the KJV, and we began to unravel some of these. First, we compared the KJV with the
Tyndale Bible which preceded it, allowing us to compare and correct some of the conclusions made by the KJV editors.
However, we corrected the New Testament by using the Stephanus Textus Receptus and comparing each term using
Strong’s Greek Concordance and other Greek Lexicons, including several Greek Online Dictionaries and the Septuagint.
Initially, we used the Hebrew Masoretic text for purposes of cyphering the underlying Hebrew, the Strong’s Hebrew
Concordance and other Hebrew Lexicons; however, in the final analysis, we have made reference to over five databases
for the Hebrew text (excluding the Dead Sea Scrolls). In addition, we have made comparisons across other English texts
(most of which having glaring errors and omissions), and relied upon other Textus Receptus editions, the Latin Vulgate,
the Codex Vaticanus, the Shem Tov Hebrew Gospel of Matthew, as well as other source material using state-of-the-art
software systems for reference.

   As you might imagine, we were simply stunned at what we found. First, the most important names in the Bible had not
been translated, or even transliterated. Instead, the names were substituted! We found this alarming, particularly in light of
 scriptural references being expressed about publishing and declaring the name. This is when we elected to add the sacred
   name to the text, which was no easy task. We were misled by the Masoretic text and had to reach our own conclusion;
however, after testing the sacred name in Israel over a period of two years, we came to conclude that the name is properly
  pronounced YAHUAH. Once we reached this conclusion, we decided to correctly transliterate all of the other names in
  the text. This resulted in 3800 name changes! Again, we were stunned at what we learned because all of the names have
              particular meaning; which reveals so much more!” Online Source: (http://www.cepher.net/about.aspx)



I find it interesting that this team of investigators confessed that they were “misled” by the Masoretic text. In this project,
we have been learning that aside from replacement titles, vowel points surrounding The Name of ‫יהוה‬, has corrupted The
Name in the Masoretic text. This includes other Hebrew names as well. Still, it is quite clear, that this publishing team,
continues to use the vowel points in this translation of the "‫ את‬Cepher”. Nevertheless, The Name of Yahūah and
Yahūshâ, has finally broken free of them. On the following page, I have inserted a few screen captures of the preface
within the "‫ את‬Cepher”. These screen captures will give you a glimpse of why the “Cepher Publishing Group” decided to
use The Name of Yahūah and Yahūshâ, in this new translation of the scriptures. Make no mistake, this publication of the
scriptures is unprecedented.

                This is a preview of the first 3 verses of the book of Revelation within the ‫ את‬Cepher.




This is the first ‘Bible’ translation in print, ever, that carries the correct English transliteration of “Yahūshâ” for The
                       Saviors Name. The Salvation of Yahūah is being revealed in these last days.

Section 2: Chap 8                     AHYAH: Name or Accolade?




                                                        Did you notice that the writer of this Preface claims that Yahūah
                                                        “gives his name as” in Shamūṭh/Ex 3:14? Well, did He? Many
                                                        actually believe that The Most High revealed His Name in
                                                        Shamūṭh/Ex 3:14 as Åhýah/‫אהיה‬. This teaching is widespread. This
                                                        claim needs to be proven. The “Wikipedia” insert found in the
                                                        Introduction of this book states, “Scholars widely propose that the name
                                                        YHWH is a verb form derived from the Biblical Hebrew triconsonantal root
                                                        ‫( היה‬h-y-h) “to be”, which has ‫( הוה‬h-w-h) as a variant form, with a third
                                                        person masculine y- prefix. It is connected to the passage in Exodus 3:14 in
                                                        which God gives his name as ‫( אֶ ְהיֶה אֲ ֶשׁר אֶ ְהיֶה‬Ehyeh Asher Ehyeh),
                                                        translated most basically as “I am that I am” (or “I Will Be What I Will Be”,
                                                        “I Will Be What I Am”).

                                                        view. I don’t think it would be necessary to include quotes from other
                                                        writers or scholars on this subject. It would just take up more space in

                                                        goes back a long way. So, without getting caught up in all the hoopla,
                                                        let’s just keep it simple, shall we?

Verse 15 reveals His Name. Verse 14 does not. Pardon me, for being so blunt. Now, I believe, that what was said in verse
14, is a characteristic or accolade of His Name; a description of His power or being to self-exist. His Name is given in vs.
15 with the H3068 assigned to it. Åhýah in vs. 14, has the H1961 assigned to it (See p. 73). One is a name, and the other is
not. One was spoken as a name, and the other was not. But, what I believe is of no consequence to what is actually in the
original script. My opinion proves nothing. So, how can I prove what I believe? If someone asks me about this issue, how
can I answer their question accurately, with witnesses, in the Hebrew text? Well, you have to look at what He said, not
what you assume He said, based on published literature you have been fed with over the years. Remember the “Make the
lie big, make it simple, keep saying it, and eventually they will believe it” quote by Adolf Hitler? We have all fallen prey
to this trick. Nobody has escaped it. So, let’s look at the first portion of the Hebrew text in verse 15. Remember, to read
the Hebrew backwards. Ehyeh Asher Ehyeh/‫ אֶ ְהיֶה אֲ ֶשׁר אֶ ְהיֶה‬- this should read like this: Åhýah ashar Åhýah/‫אהיה אשר אהיה‬


                  ‫ויאמר עוד אלהים אל־משה כה־תאמר אל־בני‬
                   sons    to       speak     thus         Mashah       to         Ålahým     moreover     And said


                                            Now, the second portion of the text.
                                                     (Ålahý is a form of Ålahým)

                          ‫ישראל יהוה אלהי אבתיכם אלהי אברהם אלהי‬
                          Ålahý   Åbraham       Ålahý        your fathers     Ålahý    Yahūah     Yasharʿål
                                                                                                                  Page 83 of 396


                                             Here, is the third portion of the text.


                ‫יצחק ואלהי יעקב שלחני אליכם זה־שמי לעלם וזה‬
                And this forever   my name - this       to you       has sent me    Yʿâqb   And Ålahý Yatscḥaq


                                             Here, is the fourth portion of the text.


                                                      ‫זכרי לדר דר׃‬
                                                    generations to all   my remembrance

Just observing the highlighted text alone, can solve this riddle. But if someone wanted to get nasty about it, there are
plenty of options for digging up witnesses on this issue, besides the obvious on this page. Without going any further, it is
clear that a name is used in the text. One might argue, vs. 14 lists Åhýah as a name too. For the sake of argument, let’s
disregard the knowledge that Åhýah is a verb form altogether. Let’s also disregard Yahūah as a noun, or definite article, in
vs. 15. With the tools we have been given to work with, how can we reach beyond persuasive evidence? What steps can
we take, that will help us attain conclusive evidence: that which renders the argument to completion; leaving thoughts of
doubt as miniscule, to virtually nonexistent. Even though we can see that a name is clear in vs. 15, we can take this
investigation further; beyond the English, and beyond one word. Now, let me tell you the steps I took to prove out this
particular controversy to myself. I will show you how I attained conclusive evidence in the Åhýah –Yahūah controversy. I
simply cannot be moved in my beliefs on this matter, and this is the reason why.

Step one: I went into The Word software on my computer and typed in this four letter Hebrew word: ‫אהיה‬
Before I go any further, I want to give a quick introduction to The Word software for new students. This software is a
must have for studying the scriptures. It’s easy to use, relatively easy to learn navigation, and best of all, it is free. You
can download it from “www.theword.net”. Back to step one.

                I have highlighted the words where Åhýah, for H1961, is located in the English and Hebrew.
                                 “The Blue Letter Bible” only shows 32 passages for Åhýah.

B rʿåshýṭh/Gen 26:3 “Sojourn in this land. And I shall be with you and favor you, for I give all these lands to you and your seed. And I
shall establish the oath which I swore to Åbraham your father.”
          ‫גור בארץ הזאת ואהיה עמך ואברכך כי־לך ולזרעך אתן את־כל־הארצת האל והקמתי את־השבעה אשר נשבעתי לאברהם אביך׃‬

B rʿåshýṭh/Gen 31:3 And Yahūah/‫ יהוה‬said to Yʿâqb, “Return to the land of your fathers and to your relatives. And I am with you.”
                                      ‫ויאמר יהוה אל־יעקב שוב אל־ארץ אבותיך ולמולדתך ואהיה עמך׃‬


Shamūṭh/Ex 3:12 And He said, “Because I am with you. And this is to you the sign that I have sent you: When you have brought the
people out of Matsarým, you are to serve Ålahým on this mountain.”
                ‫ויאמר כי־אהיה עמך וזה־לך האות כי אנכי שלחתיך בהוציאך את־העם ממצרים תעבדון את־האלהים על ההר הזה׃‬

Shamūṭh/Ex 3:14 And Ålahým said to Mashah, “I am that which I am.” And He said, “Thus you shall say to the children of Yasharʿål,
‘I am has sent me to you.’ ”
                          ‫ויאמר אלהים אל־משה אהיה אשר אהיה ויאמר כה תאמר לבני ישראל אהיה שלחני אליכם׃‬

Shamūṭh/Ex 4:12 “And now, go, and I shall be with your mouth and teach you what to say.”
                                             ‫ועתה לך ואנכי אהיה עם־פיך והוריתיך אשר תדבר׃‬

Shamūṭh/Ex 4:15 “And you shall speak to him and put the words in his mouth. And I am with your mouth and with his mouth, and I
shall teach you what to do.

Dabarým/Deut 31:23 And He commanded Yahūshâ son of Nūn, and said, “Be strong and courageous, for you are to bring the children
of Yasharʿål into the land of which I swore to them, and I Myself am with you.”
              ‫ויצו את־יהושע בן־נון ויאמר חזק ואמץ כי אתה תביא את־בני ישראל אל־הארץ אשר־נשבעתי להם ואנכי אהיה עמך׃‬

Yahūshâ/Josh 1:5 “No man is going to stand before you all the days of your life. As I was with Mashah, so I am with you. I do not fail
you nor forsake you.
                           ‫לא־יתיצב איש לפניך כל ימי חייך כאשר הייתי עם־משה אהיה עמך לא ארפך ולא אעזבך׃‬

Yahūshâ/Josh 3:7 And Yahūah/‫ יהוה‬said to Yahūshâ, “This day I begin to make you great before the eyes of all Yasharʿål, so that
they know that I am with you as I was with Mashah.

Shamūʿål Ålaph/1Sam 18:18 And Dūd said to Shʿåŭl, “Who am I, and what is my life or my father’s clan in Yasharʿål, that I am son-
in-law to the sovereign?”

reign over Yasharʿål, and I am to be next to you. Even my father Shʿåŭl knows that.”

Shamūʿål Býṭh/2Sam 15:34 but if you return to the city, and say to Åbshalūm, ‘I am your servant, O sovereign – once servant of your
father, but now I am your servant,’ then you shall nullify the counsel of Åcḥýthaphal for me.

This is such an interesting study. Already I can see how this word is used: “I am,” “I shall be,” “I will become.” It’s like,
the description of His Name is foretelling His character of existence. “I exist to be your Ålahým.” Gnaw on that for
awhile. In addition to this, 10 of these passages that use the verb Åhýah/‫אהיה‬, also use The Hebrew Name Yahūah/‫יהוה‬
within the same passage. I want to reiterate why I would ever do such a study: to prove or clarify, whether or not the verb
Åhýah is a name, or a characteristic of a name; and to find witnesses in the Hebrew text to support my findings.

Now, put all this aside for a minute. Everything I just did in my software program, may be to some students, a bit overkill.
But, it was worth the effort. I learned some things. I also learned that I don’t know much. This makes me hungry to learn
more. I can however, be for certain that I missed something in this study. As long as I am alive, I can always go back into
my notes and dig up more information. I understand why some of you would think this might be overkill. Because
Shamūṭh/Ex 3:15 clearly reveals His Name, and clarified it with this phrase, “This is My Name” / ‫זה־שמי‬. Sometimes, it
takes a whole lot more than the obvious to use as witnesses to unravel a false implication. Just because the English
translation says something that seems to support our argument, we still need to prove it by the Hebrew text.

Step 2:
Now, leaving the best part of this study for last, I know that name in Hebrew is Shm/‫שם‬. If I was to see in the Hebrew,
the word ‫( שמו‬shmū), I know it would say; His Name. ‫( שמי‬shmý) is; my name. ‫( שמך‬shmak) is; your name. These are
conjugated forms of the word Shm/‫שם‬. Adding an additional character to this word changes the possession: my name, his
name, your name. Did you notice the last letter in ‫ ?שם‬It doesn’t seem to be found in any of the conjugated forms does
it? The mým has two forms: ‫מ‬-‫ם‬. Make sure you know the difference between these two forms. Otherwise, you will be
typing in the wrong word for your word searches. One form is called the final mým and is only found at the end of a word
in Hebrew (See Hebrew chart on p. 10). If you don’t do your homework, this can cause a serious amount of wasted effort,
not to mention a serious headache. It is an easy mistake to make, so don’t be too hard on yourself if it happens too often.

So far, I have searched out Åhýah/‫ אהיה‬in the Hebrew and found 51 passages that consistently support my claim that it is:
an accolade or characteristic. This characteristic or verb is used as: to be; I am (with you); I will be (with you); I shall be
(your Ålahým); I will become (your Ålahým). That is plenty of witnesses for that portion of the study. But, what if one
was to have no knowledge of the word ‫ ?שם‬How does a first time student prove the English translation portion of this
passage that says, “This is My Name” without knowing how to read Hebrew? The Ålaph Býṭh chart is your first step.
Learn those letters. Your second step, is to look into the English translation that includes “Strong’s” reference numbers. A
“Hebrew and English Interlinear Bible” would be ideal. Downloading “The Word” software into your computer would be
even better. Whatever you choose, the “Strong’s” numbers will give access to Hebrew words that you can isolate for
study. Look these words up, learn them, so you will know them.

The H8034 is assigned to ‫שם‬. “Brown-Driver-Briggs” gives it this definition: name; memorial; monument; reputation. To
dig up conjugated forms of ‫שם‬, type in English, “my name”, “his name”, “your name”. Then, change your English
translation passage, to a Hebrew text such as the “Hisb” (Hebrew Interpolated Study Bible) or “WLC” (Westminster
Leningrad Codex). Shamūṭh/Ex 3:15 shown in the “Hisb” would look like this:

The helpful thing about using this Study Bible is that the conjugated counterpart is separated from the word by a dot.
What a wonderful tool to have for the new student when on the hunt for conjugated words. Notice the highlighted word?
Zkr/‫ זכר‬is the H2143: Rememberance. Add the Yd/‫י‬, and it says, “my remembrance”. This handy tool tells you what the
conjugated counterpart is by separating it from the word, ‫זכר‬.

You can do this with the word “Ålahým” as well. You can do this with any word to find its conjugated counterpart. The
more understanding you have about how conjugated words work in the Hebrew language, the more helpful this will be in
your understanding of how the Hebrew language puts words and phrases together. ‫( השם‬hashm) is the conjugated form of
‫ שם‬which means “the name”. ‫( בשם‬bshm) is the conjugated form of ‫ שם‬which is translated, “in the name”.

Now, I need to find scripture witnesses for this conjugated word, Shmý/‫שמי‬. I am looking for consistant usage of the
Hebrew word, ‫ שמי‬translated: “my name”, with Yahūah/‫ יהוה‬speaking in the passage. Here is what I found.


    YaramYahū/Jer 16:21 “Therefore see, I am causing them to know. This time I cause them to know Åṭh/‫ את‬My Hand and Åṭh/‫את‬
    My Might. And they shall know that Shamý/‫( שמי‬My Name) is Yahūah/‫”!יהוה‬


              ‫לכן הנני מודיעם בפעם הזאת אודיעם את־ידי ואת־גבורתי וידעו כי ־ שמי יהוה׃ ס‬
                yahūah    my name(is) - that


                             More of these witnesses are found on p. 111. No need to list them here.


             As I review these notes, I can look at both passages in the English, then view them in the Hebrew.

Shamūṭh/Exod 3:14 And Ålahým said to Mashah, “I am that which I am.” And He said, “Thus you shall say to the children of
Yasharʿål, ‘I am has sent me to you.’ ” (He never said this was His Name. His Name was given in the next passage.)

               ‫ויאמר אלהים אל־משה אהיה אשר אהיה ויאמר כה תאמר לבני ישראל אהיה שלחני אליכם׃‬

Shamūṭh/Exod 3:15 And Ålahým said further to Mashah, “Thus you are to say to the children of Yasharʿål, ‘Yahūah/‫ יהוה‬Ålahým of
your fathers, the Ålahým of Åbraham, the Ålahým of Yatscḥaq, and the Ålahým of Yʿâqb, has sent me to you. This is Shmý/‫( שמי‬My
Name) forever, and this is My remembrance to all generations.’(“This is My Name” means He revealed His Name in vs. 15.)


   ‫ויאמר עוד אלהים אל־משה כה־תאמר אל־בני ישראל יהוה אלהי אבתיכם אלהי אברהם‬
       ‫אלהי יצחק ואלהי יעקב שלחני אליכם זה ־ שמי לעלם וזה זכרי לדר דר׃‬
                            my       this and         (is)my name – this
                         remembrance

H1961- ‫ היה‬to be, become, come to pass, exist, happen, fall out (incorrect root for H3068; See p. 73)
H3068- ‫ יהוה‬the proper name of the one true God/Ålahým
      a. unpronounced except with the vowel pointing of 0136 (Adonai)
Both definitions taken from “Brown-Driver-Briggs” Hebrew definitions in “The Word” software.
(Notice the ‫ ו‬is used frequently in Hebrew for the word and.)
I am almost finished with this study on Åhýah/‫אהיה‬. Do you remember how I typed in my search word in “The Word”
software at the beginning of this study? I typed in the four letter spelling (‫ )אהיה‬as it is found in the 14th vs. of
Shamūṭh/Ex chapter 3. Now, I will do a search by typing in the three letter spelling without the ålaph (‫)היה‬.
                                                                                                                      Page 90 of 396

This word is found 1,423 times in the WLC. How can I be sure how this 3 letter word (‫)היה‬, with the Hebrew reference
number H1961, is used contextually if I don’t look into all these passages? I can’t. It is impossible without completing the
study all the way through. However, at this point, I am pretty comfortable with what I have. The information in verse 15 is
mighty convincing. Still, I think it would be wise to check out what the rest of those passages are hiding. Here are the
results. Step 3.

1.                                                   YAHUAH IS! ‫היה‬          ‫יהוה‬
Shamūʿål Ålaph/1Sam 20:42 And Yahūnaṭhan said to Dūd, “Go in peace, since we have both sworn in the Name of Yahūah/‫יהוה‬,
saying, ‘Yahūah/‫ יהוה‬is between you and me, and between your seed and my seed, forever.’ ” Then he arose and left, and
Yahūnaṭhan went into the city.

‫ויאמר יהונתן לדוד לך לשלום אשר נשבענו שנינו אנחנו בשם יהוה לאמר יהוה יהיה ביני ובינך ובין זרעי ובין זרעך‬
                                    ‫עד־עולם׃ פ ויקם וילך ויהונתן בא העיר׃‬
                                This passage can be translated, “Yahūah exists between you and me...”



2.                                             YAHUAH SHALL BE! ‫יהוה‬                ‫היה‬
Shamūʿål Ålaph/1Sam 24:15 “And Yahūah/‫ יהוה‬shall be judge; and rightly rule between you and me. See and plead my case, and
rightly rule me out of your hand.”

                           ‫והיה יהוה לדין ושפט ביני ובינך וירא וירב את־ריבי וישפטני מידך׃ פ‬
                           This passage can be translated, “Yahūah shall exist as judge; and rightly rule...”



3.                                     THE WORD OF YAHUAH CAME! ‫יהוה‬                      ‫היה‬
Shamūʿål Býṭh/2Sam 24:11 And Dūd rose up in the morning, and The Word of Yahūah/‫ יהוה‬came to the nabýå Gad, Dūd seer, saying,
                               ‫ויקם דוד בבקר פ ודבר־יהוה היה אל־גד הנביא חזה דוד לאמר‬
            The red portion of this passage can also be translated, “and The Word of Yahūah arose” or arose to exist/to be.

                                                     This is getting really cool!

                                                   YAHUAH WAS! ‫היה‬           ‫יהוה‬
4.
Malakým Ålaph/1Kgs 1:37 “As Yahūah/‫ יהוה‬was with my master the sovereign, so let Him be with Shalamah and make his throne
greater than the throne of my master Sovereign Dūd.”

                       ‫כאשר היה יהוה עם־אדני המלך כן יהי עם־שלמה ויגדל את־כסאו מכסא אדני המלך דוד׃‬
                          This passage can be translated, “Yahūah existed with my master the sovereign...”

                                                MY NAME EXISTS! ‫יהיה־שמי‬
5.
Malakým Ålaph/1Kgs 8:29 “For Your eyes to be open toward this House night and day, toward the place of which You said, ‘My
Name is there,’ to listen to the prayer which Your servant makes toward this place.

     ‫להיות עינך פתחות אל־הבית הזה לילה ויום אל־המקום אשר אמרת יהיה שמי שם לשמע אל־התפלה אשר יתפלל עבדך אל־המקום‬
                                                      ‫הזה׃‬
                                      This passage can be translated, “My Name exists there...”

                                                MY NAME EXISTS! ‫יהיה־שמי‬
6.
Dabarý Ha Yamým Býṭh/2Chr 33:4 And he built Slaughter Places in the House of Yahūah/‫יהוה‬, of which Yahūah/‫ יהוה‬had said, “In
Yarūshalam is My Name, forever.”
                                 ‫ובנה מזבחות בבית יהוה אשר אמר יהוה בירושלם יהיה־שמי לעולם׃‬
                             This passage can be translated, “In Yarūshalam, My Name exists forever...”

       This study is ringing some bells. What I am seeing, is reminding me of some passages that I can’t seem to shake.

Cḥazūn/Rev 1:8 “I am the ‘Ålaph’ and the ‘Ṭū’, Beginning and End,” says Yahūah/‫“ יהוה‬who is and who was and who is to come,
the Almighty.”

YashâYahū/Isa 41:4 “Who has performed and done it, calling the generations from the beginning? ‘I, Yahūah/‫יהוה‬, the first, and with
the last I am He.’ ”
                               ‫מי־פעל ועשה קרא הדרות מראש אני יהוה ראשון ואת־אחרנים אני־הוא׃‬

Now, that I have thoroughly searched out all 51 passages for Åhýah/‫אהיה‬, and all 1,423 passages for Hýah/‫היה‬, I have
come to a reasonable conclusion from my findings. I believe this is sufficient and conclusive evidence, to support my
claim that was stated from the beginning of the study. Step one revealed: Åhýah is used as a characteristic; a description;
accolade; to be, to exist. Step two revealed: looking at conjugated forms of the word Shm/‫שם‬, confirms what is written in
the Hebrew text in vs. 15 when He said, “This is My Name”/‫זה שמי‬. Step 3 revealed: The Name of Yahūah and Hýah or
Åhýah, can sit side by side within the same passage; and affects past, present, and future tense; within the context of the
passage. Out of a total of 1,474 passages, not one passage revealed Hýah or Åhýah to be exclusivley related to:

         ‘My Name Åhýah’, which would look like this in Hebrew: ‫ שמי אהיה‬no passage found
         ‘This is My Name Åhýah’, which would look like this in Hebrew: ‫ זה שמי אהיה‬no passage found
         ‘I am Åhýah. That is My Name’, which would look like this in Hebrew: ‫ אני אהיה הוא שמי‬no passage found
         ‘In The Name Åhýah’, which would look like this in Hebrew: ‫ בשם אהיה‬no passage found
         ‘The Name Åhýah’, which would look like this in Hebrew: ‫ השמ אהיה‬no passage found
         Åný/‫ אני‬Åhýah’ meaning, ‘I am Åhýah/‫ ’אהיה‬no passage found (It would look like this in the Hebrew: ‫)אני אהיה‬
         Åný/‫ אני‬Hýah meaning, ‘I am Hýah/‫ היה‬no passage found (It would look like this in the Hebrew: ‫)אני היה‬
                                                                                                          Page 92 of 396

    There are however, plenty of passages revealing:

             ‘My Name Yahūah’ in Hebrew: ‫ שמי יהוה‬Found: Malʿåký/Mal 1:11 (See p.111)
             ‘This is My Name Yahūah’ in Hebrew: ‫ זה שמי יהוה‬Found: Shamūṭh/Ex 3:15
             ‘I am Yahūah. That is My Name’ in Hebrew: ‫ אני יהוה הוא שמי‬Found: YashâYahū/Isa 42:8 (See p. 96)
             ‘In The Name Yahūah’ in Hebrew: ‫ בשם יהוה‬Found: Shamūṭh/Ex 33:19 (See p. 105)
             ‘The Name Yahūah’ in Hebrew: ‫ השמ יהוה‬Found: Dabarým/Deut 32:3 (See p. 120)
             Åný/‫ אני‬Yahūah’ meaning, ‘I am Yahūah: ‫ אני יהוה‬Found: Shamūṭh/Ex 10:2 (See p. 96)

The Most High did not give His Name in Shamūṭh/Ex 3:14. He just simply said, “to be” or who was, is and is to come, all
wrapped up into one word: Åhýah. This statement He made, reveals some unexpected treasures, about His character. His
character is attached to a Name. He claims to be The One who Was, Is and The One to Become; to Come; to Arrive; to
Come on the scene. No matter how you slice it, Åhýah is not a name. This verb describes what His Name was, is and will
Become to us; because The Name of Yahūah is full of salvation and deliverance! This Name Yahūah, is the only place
you can find life, salvation, cover, knowledge, healing, peace, righteousness, favor, mercy, love, greatness which is the
seat of humility according to The Word of Yahūah. Perfection; which is the fullness of maturity in your walk with
Yahūshâ; who is The Word of Yahūah; Safety from His wrath; which doesn’t even scratch the surface. Now that sounds
like A Name above every name!

This "‫ את‬Cepher” translation of the scriptures, revealing The Name of Yahūah and Yahūshâ in the English translation,
reminds me of some foretelling’s about His Name in the end days. Here are a few of those passages of scripture referring
to ‫יהוה‬, and how His Name will be great among the Gentiles. The following passage gives more than enough evidence to
support my claim for Shamŭṭh/Ex 3:15.

(NET)
Malʿåký/Mal 1:11 For from the east to the west My Name will be great among the nations. Incense and pure offerings
will be offered in My Name everywhere, for My Name will be great among the nations,” says Yahūah/‫ יהוה‬Tsabʿåŭṭh.

  ‫כי ממזרח־שמש ועד־מבואו גדול שמי בגוים ובכל־מקום מקטר מגש לשמי ומנחה טהורה כי־גדול שמי בגוים אמר‬
                                            ‫יהוה צבאות׃‬

Yacḥazaqʿål/Ezek 36:23 I will magnify My Great Name that has been profaned among the nations that you have profaned
among them. The nations will know that I am Yahūah/‫יהוה‬, declares Ådaný Yahūah/‫יהוה אדני‬, when I Magnify Myself
among you in their sight.

Dabarým/Deut 30:1-3 “And it shall be, when all These Words come upon you, The Barakah and The Curse which I have
set before you, and you shall bring them back to your heart among all the gentiles where Yahūah/‫ יהוה‬your Ålahým drives
you, 2and shall turn back to Yahūah/‫ יהוה‬your Ålahým and obey His Voice, according to all that I Command you today,
with all your heart and with all your being, you and your children, 3then Yahūah/‫ יהוה‬your Ålahým shall turn back your
captivity, and your compassion, and He shall turn back and gather you from all the peoples where Yahūah/‫ יהוה‬your
Ålahým has scattered you.

  Tell me something. Where is “Åhýah, your Ålahým” in the Hebrew text? It would look like this in the Hebrew below:

                                    *‫ – אהיה אלהיך‬translated as: Åhýah, your Ålahým
        I challenge anyone to find this in any Hebrew/Aramaic script. Also, When is Åhýah/‫ אהיה‬not used as a verb?
*‫( אלהיך‬See p. 132)

                 Characteristics in English and in Hebrew, are in red. The Name of Yahūah in Hebrew, is in blue.

B rʿåshýṭh/Gen 2:4 These are the births of the heavens and the earth when they were created, in the day that
Yahūah/‫ יהוה‬Ålahým (mighty ones; see B rʿåshýṭh/Gen 1:26) made earth and heavens. (‫)יהוה אלהים‬
B rʿåshýṭh/Gen 21:33 And he planted a tamarisk tree in Bʿår Shabâ, and there called on the Name of Yahūah/‫יהוה‬,
Everlasting Mighty One (‫)יהוה אל עולם‬.
B rʿåshýṭh/Gen 22:14 And Åbraham called the name of the place, ‘Yahūah/‫ יהוה‬Yråʾah,’ as it is said to this day, “On the
mountain Yahūah/‫ יהוה‬provides.” (‫)יהוה יראה‬
B rʿåshýṭh/Gen 16:13 And she called the Name of Yahūah/‫ יהוה‬who spoke to her, “You are the Ål who sees,” for she
said, “Even here have I seen after Him who sees me?” (‫)יהוה ראי‬
B rʿåshýṭh/Gen 17:1 And it came to be when Åbram was ninety-nine years old, that Yahūah/‫ יהוה‬appeared to Åbram
and said to him, “I am Ål Shdý – walk before Me and be perfect. (‫)יהוה אל שדי‬
Shamūṭh/Ex 15:26 And He said, “If you diligently obey The Voice of Yahūah/‫ יהוה‬your Ålahým and do what is right in
His Eyes, and shall listen to His Commands and shall guard all His Laws, I shall bring on you none of the diseases I
brought on the Matsarým, for I am Yahūah/‫ יהוה‬your Healer.” (‫)אני יהוה רפאך‬
Shamūṭh/Ex 17:15, 16 And Mashah built a Slaughter Place and called its name, Yahūah/‫ יהוה‬is my Nasý (banner). 16For
he said, “Because a hand is on the throne of Yah, Yahūah/‫ יהוה‬is to fight against Âmalq, from generation to
generation.” (‫)יהוה נסי‬
Shamūṭh/Ex 31:13 “And you, speak to the children of Yasharʿål, saying, ‘My Shabaṭhs you are to guard, by all means, for
it is a sign between Me and you throughout your generations, so you may know that it is I am, Yahūah/‫יהוה‬, mqdashcm
(who sets you apart).’” (‫ ) אני יהוה מקדשכם‬Most translations render this verse as, “’...who Sanctifies you.’”
Dabarým/Deut 26:17 “You have today caused Yahūah/‫ יהוה‬Åūṭh to proclaim to be your Ålahým, and to walk in His
Ways and guard His Laws, and His Commands, and His Right-Rulings, and to obey His Voice. (‫)יהוה את‬
Dabarý/Deut 30:20 “…to love Yahūah/‫ יהוה‬your Ålahým, to obey His Voice, and to cling to Him – for He is your Cḥý
(life) and the length of your days – to dwell in the land which Yahūah/‫ יהוה‬swore to your fathers, to Åbraham, to
Yatscḥaq, and to Y῾âqb, to give them.” (‫)יהוה חי‬
Shaphatým/Judg 6:23, 24 And Yahūah/‫ יהוה‬said to him, “Peace be with you! Do not fear, you do not die.” 24And
Gadʿâŭn built a Slaughter Place there to Yahūah/‫יהוה‬, and called it: Yahūah/‫ יהוה‬Shalūm. To this day it is still in Âphrah
of the Åbý Hʿâzrý. (‫)יהוה שלום‬
NacḥamYah/Neh 8:10 Then he said to them, “Go, eat the fat, drink the sweet, and send portions to those for whom
none is prepared. For this day is set-apart to our Master. Do not be sad, for the joy of Yahūah/‫ יהוה‬is mʿâzcm.” (your
strength.) (‫)יהוה מעזכם‬
Ṭahalým/Ps 8:1 Yahūah/‫יהוה‬, Ådanýnū (our Master), how excellent is Your Name in all the earth; You who set Your
splendour above the heavens! (‫)יהוה אדנינו‬
Ṭahalým/Ps 23:1 Yahūah/‫ יהוה‬is Rʿâý (my shepherd; see Yahūcḥanan/Jn 10:11); I do not lack. (‫רעי‬  ‫)יהוה‬
Mashalý/Prov 20:22 Do not say, “I repay evil.” Wait for Yahūah/‫יהוה‬, and He Yashâ (saves) you. (‫)יהוה ישע‬
YashâYahū/Isa 6:3 And one cried to another and said, “Set-Apart, Set-Apart, Set-Apart is Yahūah/‫ יהוה‬Tsabʿåŭṭh (army
or resources/His Creation) All the earth is filled with His esteem!”(‫)יהוה צבאת‬
                                                                                                        Page 95 of 396

YashâYahū/Isa 49:26 “And I shall feed those who oppress you with their own flesh, and let them drink their own blood
as sweet wine. All flesh shall know that I, Yahūah/‫יהוה‬, am your Mūshýacḥ (Savior), and your Redeemer, The Ålahým of
Y῾âqb.” (‫)יהוה מושיח‬
YaramYahū/Jer 23:6 “In His days Yahūdah shall be saved, and Yasharʿål dwell safely. And this is His Name whereby He
shall be called: ‘Yahūah/‫ יהוה‬our Righteousness.’ (‫)יהוה צדקנו‬
Yacḥazaqʿål/Ezek 34:24 “And I, Yahūah/‫יהוה‬, Åhýah (shall be) their Ålahým, and My servant Dūd a prince in their midst.
I, Yahūah/‫יהוה‬, have spoken. (‫)יהוה אהיה‬
Yacḥazaqal/Ezek 48:35 “All around: eighteen thousand cubits. And the name of the city from that day is: Yahūah/‫ יהוה‬is
there!” (‫)יהוה שמה‬

   relation to Sham/‫( שם‬Name) of Yahūah/‫יהוה‬, she came to test him with hard questions.
   Dabarý Ha Yamým Ålaph/1Chr 22:7 Dūd said to Shalamah, “My son, I had it in my heart to build a House for
   Sham/‫( שם‬Name) of Yahūah/‫ יהוה‬my Ålahým.”
   Dabarý Ha Yamým Ålaph/1Chr 22:19 “Now, devote your heart and being to seek Yahūah/‫ יהוה‬your Ålahým. Begin to
   build Åṭh/‫את‬- the Set-Apart place of Yahūah/‫ יהוה‬Ålahým, so that you may bring Åṭh/‫את‬-The Ark of the Covenant
   of Yahūah/‫ יהוה‬and the Set-Apart Articles belonging to Ålahým into The House that will be built for Sham/‫שם‬
   (Name) of Yahūah/‫יהוה‬.”
   Dabarý Ha Yamým Býṭh/2Chr 2:1 Shalamah ordered a House be built for Sham/‫( שם‬Name) of Yahūah/‫ יהוה‬and a
   royal palace.
   Dabarý Ha Yamým Býṭh/2Chr 6:7 “And it came to be within the heart of Dūýd my father, to build a House for
   Sham/‫( שם‬Name) of Yahūah/‫יהוה‬, the Ålahým of Yasharʿål.”
   Dabarý Ha Yamým Býṭh/2Chr 6:10 Now Yahūah/‫ יהוה‬has established Åṭh/‫את‬-His Word which He spoke, and I have
   been raised up instead of my father Dūýd/‫דויד‬, and sit on the throne of Yasharʿål, as Yahūah/‫ יהוה‬Promised. And I
   have built The House for Sham/‫( שם‬Name) of Yahūah/‫ יהוה‬Ålahým of Yasharʿål.
   Åýūb/Job 1:21 “…And said, “Naked I came from my mother’s womb, and naked I will depart. Yahūah/‫ יהוה‬gave and

   Ṭahalým/Ps 7:17 I will give thanks to Yahūah/‫ יהוה‬because of His Righteousness, and sing praise to Sham/‫( שם‬Name)
   of Yahūah/‫ יהוה‬Most High.
   Ṭahalým/Ps 102:21 Sham/‫( שם‬Name) of Yahūah/‫ יהוה‬will be declared in Tsýūn and His Praise in Yarūshalam.

    Ṭahalým/Ps 113:2 Let Sham/‫( שם‬Name) of Yahūah/‫ יהוה‬be bowed to, now and forever more.
    Ṭahalým/Ps 113:3 From the rising of the sun to its setting, Sham/‫( שם‬Name) of Yahūah/‫ יהוה‬is to be praised.
    Ṭahalým/Ps 122:4 “…where the tribes go up, the Tribes of *Yah/‫יה‬, according to the testimony of Yasharʿål; to give
    thanks to Sham/‫( שם‬Name) of Yahūah/‫יהוה‬.
    Ṭahalým/Ps 135:1 Praise *Yah/‫יה‬. Praise Åṭh/‫את‬- Sham/‫( שם‬Name) of Yahūah/‫יהוה‬. Praise Him, you servants of

    Ṭahalým/Ps 148:13 Let them praise Åṭh/‫את‬- Sham/‫( שם‬Name) of Yahūah/‫יהוה‬, for His Name alone is exalted. His
    Splendor is above the earth and the heavens.
    Mashalý/Prov 18:10 Sham/‫( שם‬Name) of Yahūah/‫ יהוה‬is a Strong Tower. The righteous run to it and are safe.
    YashâYahū/Isa 18:7 At that time gifts will be brought to *Yahūah/‫ יהוה‬Tsabʿåŭṭh, from a people tall and smooth-
    skinned: from a people feared far and wide, an aggressive nation of strange speech, whose land is divided by rivers.
    Gifts will be brought to Mount Tsýūn, the place of Sham/‫( שם‬Name) Yahūah/‫ יהוה‬Tsabʿåŭṭh.
    YashâYahū/Isa 24:15 Therefore, in the east give esteem to Yahūah/‫יהוה‬. Exalt Sham/‫( שם‬Name) Yahūah/‫יהוה‬, the
    Ålahým of Yasharʿål, in the islands of the sea.
    YashâYahū/Isa 30:27 See, Sham/‫( שם‬Name) Yahūah/‫ יהוה‬comes from afar with burning anger and dense clouds of
    smoke. His lips are full of wrath and His tongue is a consuming fire.
    YashâYahū/Isa 60:9 “…to Sham/‫( שם‬Name) Yahūah/‫ יהוה‬your Ålahým, and to The Set-Apart One of Yasharʿål
    because He has beautified you.
    YaramYahū/Jer 3:17 At that time they will call Yarūshalam “The Throne of Yahūah/‫”יהוה‬, and all nations will gather
    in Yarūshalam to honor Sham/‫( שם‬Name) Yahūah/‫יהוה‬. No longer will they follow the stubbornness of their evil
    hearts.
    Yahūʿål/Joel 2:26 “You will eat in plenty. You’ll be satisfied and praise Åṭh/‫את‬- Sham/‫( שם‬Name) Yahūah/‫ יהוה‬your
    Ålahým who dealt wondrously with you. My People will never be ashamed.”
    MýkYah/Mic 5:4 He will stand and shepherd his flock in the strength of Yahūah/‫יהוה‬, in the majesty of Sham/‫שם‬
    (Name) of Yahūah/‫ יהוה‬his Ålahým. And they will live securely. Then His Greatness will reach to the ends of the earth.

-Adonai.
Adonai is the plural of Adon, meaning “Lord, Master, or owner” (the word Adon derives from a Ugaritic word meaning
“lord” or “father”). In the Tanakh, the word Adon can refer to men and angels as well as to the Lord God of Israel (e.g.,
Exodus 34: 23). God is called the “Lord of lords” (Deut 10:17) and Ps. 8:1 mentions God as “YHVH our Lord.”

The Plural form Adonai, like the plural form Elohim, is regularly used with singular verbs and modifiers, so it is best to
construe the Name as an “emphatic plural” or “plural of majesty.” When the plural is formed using a singular possessive
ending (“my Lords”), it always refers to God, and occurs over 300 times in the *Tanakh in this form.

The Masoretes ensured that the sacred Name of the Lord YHVH would not be taken in vain by putting the vowel marks for
Adonai under the letters ‫ה‬-‫ו‬-‫ה‬-‫ י‬in the running text. They did this to remind the reader to pronounce Adonai regardless of
the consonants in the text. However, Adon and Adonai also appear as Names of God in the Hebrew Masoretic text.

       After reading the above insert and the fearless practice inflicted on This Name ‫יהוה‬, let’s look at the
                                          commandment one more time.



“You shall not lift up (speak) ‫ את‬The Name of ‫ יהוה‬your Ålahým to ruin it, for ‫יהוה‬   ‫ את‬will not acquit (pardon) anyone
                                      who lifts up (speaks) ‫ את‬His Name to ruin it.

Section 3: Chap 17b

 For years I have read passages about praising, exulting and proclaiming The Name of my Creator. While working on this
 project, I was slowly led to look deeper into the word, “proclaim” (to call out;) because my research revealed a “teaching
   or doctrine” coming from the Jews that I never really payed much attention to. This “doctrine” leads the world into a
falsehood that Yahūah never taught His people. In fact the opposite is true. I have collected some notes on this subject and
                        felt it would be a subject of reasonable interest for the new student. Observe:

Dabarým/Deut 32:3 “For I proclaim (*call out) The Name of Yahūah/‫יהוה‬, ascribe (put in writing) greatness to our
Ålahým. – This passage is spoken by (Mashah/Moses) in a song, which later on, Yahūah instructs him to teach to the
children of Yasharʿål. Here are some definitions and their sources I dug up for this word, PROCLAIM.

Proclaim from: (BDB) H7121       ‫ = קרא‬to call, call out, recite, read, cry out, and proclaim; to utter a loud sound
                        to announce publicly; publish
British Dictionary Definition:
Word Origin and History for proclaim: late
                                    14c., proclamen, from Latin proclamare "cry or call out," from pro- "forth" (see pro- ) +
clamare "to cry out" (see claim (v.)). Spelling altered by influence of claim. Related: Proclaimed; proclaiming; proclaimer.

Now, as I said previously, I would stumble onto teachings from the Jews unexpectedly during the course of this project.
One of these teachings in question came up on the online etymology dictionary when I typed in “Masoretes.” Instead of
the program retrieving what I expected to be the origin for the word I typed in, this came up:

Jehovah
1530, Tyndale's erroneous transliteration of Hebrew Tetragramaton YHWH using vowel points of Adhonai "my lord" (see
Yahweh). Used for YHWH (the full name being too sacred for utterance) in four places in the Old Testament in the KJV where the
usual translation lord would have been inconvenient; taken as the principal and personal name of God. The vowel substitution was
originally made by the Masoretes as a direction to substitute Adhonai for "the ineffable name." European students of Hebrew took
this literally, which yielded Latin JeHoVa (first attested in writings of Galatinus, confessor to Leo X, 1516). Jehovah's Witnesses
"member of Watchtower Bible and Tract Society" first attested 1933; the organization founded c.1879 by Charles Taze Russell
(1852-1916); the name from Isa. xliii:10. Source: Online Etymology Dictionary

Here is a definition for “ineffable”:

Ineffable - not to be uttered: taboo <the ineffable name of Jehovah>
Online Source: (http://www.merriam-webster.com/dictionary/ineffable)
late 14c., from Old French ineffable (14c.) or directly from Latin ineffabilis "unutterable," from in- "not, opposite of" (see in- (1)) +
effabilis "speakable," from effari "utter," from ex- "out" (see ex-) + fari "speak" (see fame (n.)). Plural noun ineffables was, for a time,
a jocular euphemism for "trousers" (1823). Related: Ineffably.

Speaking This Name is not a sin! Using This Name to speak against, or commit an act against Yahūah and His Word is.
The 3rd commandment instructs us to guard against ruining His Name. We were never instructed to cease from speaking
His Name. This doctrine comes only from the Jewish community based on their Talmud. This teaching cannot be found
anywhere in Ṭūrah, the books of the Nabýʿåým, or other writings. Here is a passage where Yahūah has something to say
about His Own Name...

Shamūṭh/Ex 34:6 And Yahūah/‫ יהוה‬passed before him (Mashah/Moses) and proclaimed, “, Yahūah/‫יהוה‬,
Yahūah/‫יהוה‬, an Ål compassionate and showing favour, patient, and great in kindness and truth...” This was overlooked
apparently. Furthermore, here is a foretelling about His Name for the end days:

YaramYahū/Jer 33:16 ‘In those days Yahūdah shall be saved, and Yarūshalam dwell in safety. And this is that which
shall be proclaimed to her: ‘Yahūah/‫ יהוה‬our Righteousness.’ –Proclaim His Name! Anything else, is deceptive.

Section 3: Chap 18a

Below is a list of various forms of the Hebrew word “Ålahým” which cannot be found in any other language. Although, it
is widely taught that Ålahým is singular, this title is translated “Mighty ones”; referencing The Father and His Word in
this book. Note how a new character can stand in the place of another in the word to form a specific usage in Hebrew.
Many of these conjugated forms have been confirmed in my studies. However, some have not. Don’t be lazy in your
studies. Regardless of the source you collect your information from, make certain you can prove it over and over again in
the Hebrew text.

‫ = אלהים‬H430 Ålahým (mighty ones)
‫ = אלהיך‬Ålhýk - your Ålahým
‫ = אלהיהם‬Ålhýhk - their Ålahým
‫ = אלהי‬Ålhý - my Ålahým – may be in error: can be argued to be grammatically incorrect for Shamūth/Ex 3:15
‫ = אלהינו‬Ålhýnū - our Ålahým
‫ = אלהיו‬Ålhýū - his Ålahým
‫ = ה אלהים‬Ha Ålahým (the mighty ones)
‫= אלהיכם‬Ålhýkm (Used when Yahūah is speaking to a group of people in reference to Himself.)
‫= אליהם‬Ålýham “future tense” to them
‫= אלהם‬Ålham “perfect tense”
‫= ה אלה‬Ha Ålah these things
    Elohim
    Main article: Elohim
    (http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Names_of_God_in_Judaism#Eloah)
    A common name of *God in the Hebrew Bible is Elohim (Hebrew: About this sound ‫( אלהים‬help·info)). Despite the -im ending
    common to many plural nouns in Hebrew, the word Elohim when referring to *God is grammatically singular, and takes a singular
    verb in the Hebrew Bible. The word is identical to the usual plural of el meaning gods or magistrates, and is cognate to the 'lhm
    found in Ugaritic, where it is used for the pantheon of Canaanite gods, the children of El and conventionally vocalized as "Elohim"
    although the original Ugaritic vowels are unknown. When the Hebrew Bible uses elohim not in reference to God, it is plural (for
    example, Exodus 20:3). There are a few other such uses in Hebrew, for example Behemoth. In Modern Hebrew, the singular word
    ba'alim ("owner", "lord", or "husband") looks plural, but likewise takes a singular verb.


 The viewpoint suggested in the above Wikipedia insert calls for scrutiny and suspicion as we observe the next chapter:

Yahūah begins with, “Let Us make man in our image” indicating that Ålahým in reference to The Father and His Word
is most certainly plural. One could bring this passage into the equation:
Dabarým/Deut 6:4 “Hear, O Yasharʿål: Yahūah/‫ יהוה‬our Ålahým/‫ אלהים‬, Yahūah/‫ יהוה‬is one.
This passage is misleading us because of a mistranslation. This passage of scripture is discussed in the next chapter.
However, I would like to share my thoughts on the following passage:
Shamūṭh/Ex 4:16 “And he shall speak for you to the people. And it shall be that he shall be a mouth for you, and you
shall be an Ålahým for him.
If a message is being delivered whereas; the message comes from a higher authority, this equates to two beings at work:
     1. The messenger
     2. The one who sent the messenger
                                                                                                              Page 133 of 396

I have learned that the house of Yasharʿål did not have knowledge of The Word, as much as we think they did (YaramYahū/Jer
2:31-35). In Shamūṭh 4:14, Yahūah becomes angry with Mashah (Moses). Why? Because Mashah told Yahūah to send or
use someone else to speak His Word. That was a serious bummer to Yahūah. So, Yahūah said that He would have his
brother, Åharan, speak for Mashah. So, here is how it went down: Mashah tells his brother what to speak. But The Word he
tells his brother is not his own, but the Word given by Yahūah. This makes Mashah an Ålahým to Åharan because Åharan
is speaking what Mashah tells him to by the authority of one greater than himself (Compare Shamūṭh/Ex 7:1). This Word is
not coming from Mashah, but from Yahūah. On a side note: this is how Yahūah had to deal with His people constantly,
because they were more than often telling Him they did not want to hear from Him. If you study the text in the majority of
the Ṭūrah, you will notice Yahūah was forced to resort to a “plan B” scenario on many occasions as a result of the hard
hearts of this people.
Many scholars and Jewish (Ashkenazim) teachers are convinced, that Ålahým is singular when this title is used for rulers
or those in high authority such as magistrates or gods. This includes its use in reference to The Creator. Their argument is
firm in that it is plural when used in Shamūṭh/Ex 20:3 “Have no other Ålahým (gods) in my face”. We can go back and
forth on this all day. When one is convinced in his heart on a matter, only Yahūah can change that point of view through
seeking Him with all his might. If of course, he is so prompted to do just that on this particular subject. I disagree with the
published traditional view on “Ålahým” and here is why. The Word of Yahūah, has never spoken on His own authority in
the OT or the NT, ever. (Yahūcḥanan/Jn 7:16-19, 8:28, 38, 14:10, 24, 15:15)

If you do not know who Yahūshâ is, you cannot understand The Word of Yahūah. If at any degree, you have rejected, or
are in disagreement with The Spoken or Written Word of Yahūah (Ṭūrah), you will never know Yahūshâ. That is a fact.
Now let’s consider the following passages of scripture. Yahūah said, there is no one beside Him (YashâYahū/Isa 44:8, 45:5,
45:21). These passages declare there is no other Ål/‫( אל‬mighty one) to seek. If man imagines there are, it is a lie. Now,
this leads us to believe He is only one, right? This means, there is no word that supersedes The Word of The Father, and
there is no other Father (MaṭhaṭhYahū/Matt 23:8-10). So, there is only One Voice that comes from The Father: His Word!

Let’s look at this in light of what He said, throughout the Ṭūrah and the accounts of Yahūshâ. Don’t forget, that man is
notorious for not wanting to hear from Yahūah directly! (Shamūṭh/Ex 4:13, 20:19; Dabarým/Deut 5:25-27 etc...) The children
of Yasharʿål appoints Mashah as their leader; the one they will hear (obey); the one they will hear as if it were Yahūah
himself! This was clear. Mashah was the only one who drew near to Yahūah; they shrank back and said, “You go and
talk to Him. Don’t let Him speak to us anymore or we will die! We will hear from you (Dabarým 5:25-27).” Later, they
gave him a hard time about this arrangement that they asked for by saying, “Is it little that you have brought us up out of
a land flowing with milk and honey, to kill us in the wilderness, that you would also seize total rule over us?” B-
madbar/Num 16:13. In B-mdbar 16:28 it was proven, that the works he (Mashah) did, were not from his own heart. He
was listening to Yahūah directly. The people wanted to hear from Mashah only. Truly, this was an obstinate people.

With that as a foundation, I want to look at YashâYahū/Isa 53:9. The foretelling states, the Mashýacḥ would have no deceit
in His mouth. This is supported by Yahūcḥanan/Jn 1:47 and 1Pet 2:22. Now keep in mind, there is no other mighty one but
Yahūah according to YashâYahū, chapters 44 and 45. If I haven’t lost you, look now in YaramYahū 11:17-19. Yahūah is
speaking evil against who He planted (His people). This was a foretelling of Mashýacḥ here. They were cutting off the
commandments. What is always being planted by Yahūah? His Word in the hearts of His people (Matt 13:1-23). Yes, they
were planted in that land to grow...but from what? If they rejected The Word, then the tree (Yasharʿål) is fruitless. What did
they reject? Ṭūrah! Their salvation; Righteousness and covering. The commands; statutes and Right-Rulings. They were
planted to be a light to the nations, which in turn, the nations would learn this Law from them. This arrangement was
supposed to attract the nations to learn This Law of Yahūah (Dabarým/Deut 4:6). But they hated Ṭūrah. Yasharʿål and
Yahūdah detested The Law or Word of Yahūah (Dabarým 8:3). They were cursed for cutting off Ṭūrah (YaramYahū 11:3).
Fast forward to the days of Mashýacḥ. With no deceit in His Mouth, He claimed to be The Bread of life (Yahūcḥanan/Jn
6:58). Compare this saying with Dabarým/Deut 32:46-47. He claimed to exist before Åbraham (Yahūcḥanan/Jn 8:58).
Compare this saying with Shamūṭh/Ex 3:14. As soon as they saw The Word manifested in the flesh, they did what they
have always done. They cut their life; bread; salvation and righteousness off from themselves (Yahūcḥanan/Jn 6:54, 7:18,
8:37,10:28-29, 14:6 ). His people fulfilled the foretelling’s of Mashýacḥ by butchering Him. He claims to have been sent
                                                                                                           Page 134 of 396

from The Father (Yahūcḥanan/Jn 14:24). Let’s capsulize this: Mashýacḥ claims that The Words He speaks are not His, but
His Fathers. They are not His own works. Just like what Mashah said. The messenger and the message given by a higher
authority are two beings at work here (Yahūcḥanan/Jn 10:29; 14:24, 28). Yasharʿål could not understand this. Yahūshâ
explained to His taught ones in Luke 24:27 all the things that pertained to Him in the Ṭūrah and in the Nabýʿåým. He is
telling them or have been telling them rather, that He is the guy that has been dealing with them the whole time. Even back
before Åbraham. Yet nobody has seen the Father, other than The Word (YashâYahū/Isa 44:8, 45:5, 45:21). With that said, let’s
take a good look at Ṭahalým/Ps 110. Stay with me, I am building a case here.

Ṭahalým/Ps 110:1-7 ‫ יהוה‬said to my Master, “Sit at My right hand, Until I make Your enemies a footstool for Your feet.
2
 ‫ יהוה‬sends Your mighty scepter out of Tsýūn. Rule in the midst of Your enemies! 3Your people volunteer in the day of
Your might, in the splendors of set-apartness! From the womb, from the morning, You have the dew of Your youth! 4 ‫יהוה‬
has sworn and does not relent, “You are a Kahan forever according to the order of Malakýtsadaq.” 5 ‫ יהוה‬at Your right
hand Shall smite sovereigns in the day of His wrath. 6He judges among the nations, He shall fill the nations with dead
bodies, He shall crush the Head over the mighty earth! 7He drinks of the stream by the wayside. Therefore, He does lift up
the head!


In verse four, Malakýtsadaq is from H4442: ‫צדך‬-‫מלכי‬. This name carries two roots: H4428 and H6664. These two roots
tell us the meaning of this “MLKÝ-TSDK”. The H4428 is “King”. If you attach the Yd (‫)י‬, it becomes “my king”. The
H6664 means: justice; righteousness; rightness. So, this name would mean: “My King is Righteous” or “Righteous is My
King”. What does this have to do with my understanding of Ålahým in a plural form? Well, this song is a foretelling of
Mashýacḥ. By studying all the foretelling’s of Mashýacḥ in the Ṭūrah (Law or teachings of Yahūah), you will see that
every Word spoken by Yahūah; that His people were instructed to obey, has saving power in it. Why, how and when does
His Word have saving power in it? Does His Word have saving power in it only when we read it in the New Testament, or
is saving power available in that spoken or written word when we hear it, read and obey it in the Old Testament; as long
as we know it came from the mouth of Yahūah? In every instance Yahūah spoke in the Old Testament, that word spoken
is life to us. If I can prove the Word spoken by Yahūah, is Mashýacḥ in the Old Testament, then every Word spoken by
Mashýacḥ in the New Testament; would then be subject to every Word written in the Old Testament, that came out of the
mouth of Yahūah, right? The following, is how to prove two beings at work by our Mashýacḥ. Yet He said to His taught
ones, that His Father is greater (Yahūcḥanan/Jn 14:28).

                                                  Dabarým/Deut 8:3
“And He humbled you, and let you suffer hunger, and fed you with manna which you did not know nor did your fathers
know, to make you know that man does not live by bread alone, but by every Word that comes from the mouth of ‫יהוה‬.

Yahūcḥanan/Jn 6:31-35 “Our fathers ate the manna in the wilderness, as it has been written, ‘He gave them bread out
of the heaven to eat.’ ” 32Therefore ‫ יהושע‬said to them, “Truly, truly, I say to you, Mashah did not give you the bread out
of the heaven, but My Father gives you the true bread out of the heaven. 33For the bread of Ålahým is He who comes
down out of the heaven and gives life to the world. 34So they said to Him, “Master, give us this bread always. 35And
‫ יהושע‬said to them, “I am the bread of life. He who comes to Me shall not get hungry at all, and he who believes in Me
shall not get thirsty at all.


Does this mean that Yahūshâ Ha Mashýacḥ is replacing the Word of the OT, or is He confirming the Word spoken in the
OT? I want to compare what Yahūshâ said, with what is written about the Ṭūrah...
       Yahūshâ claims:
Therefore ‫ יהושע‬spoke to them again, saying, “I am the light of the world. He who follows Me shall by no means walk in
                      darkness, but possess the light of life.” Yahūcḥanan/Jn 8:12 (Jn 9:5, 11:10)
                                                                                                                 Page 135 of 396

YashâYahū /Isa 51:4, 5 “Listen to Me, My people, and give ear to Me, O My nation, for the Ṭūrah goes forth from Me,
and My right-ruling I set as a light to peoples. 5My righteousness is near, My deliverance shall go forth, and My arms
judge peoples. Coastlands wait upon Me, and for My arm they wait expectantly.

Here, in YashâYahū, the Law and Right-Ruling is set as a light. Mashýacḥ said in Yahūcḥanan that He is the light.
       Yahūshâ claims:
“I have come as a light into the world, so that no one who believes in Me should stay in darkness. Yahūcḥanan/Jn 12:46
                    (Yahūcḥanan/Jn 12:36) If right-ruling of Yahūah is avoided or hidden, you are in darkness.
Now, let’s see what was declared about the Ṭūrah:
YashâYahū/Isa 8:20 To the Ṭūrah and to the testimony! If they do not speak according to this Word, it is because they
have no light in them . (YashâYahū/Isa 9:2, 59:9, Ṭahalým/Ps 119:105, Mashlý/Prov 28:9) By refusing the Law, you refuse light.

Here, YashâYahū, the servant known today as Isaiah, says that if one speaks against the Ṭūrah, there is no light in them.
Yahūshâ Ha Mashýacḥ states that He came as a light into the world, so that all those believing what comes from His
mouth, should lead them out of darkness; lawlessness. This suggests He is speaking about The Law that is written. In
other words, if He does not speak according to the Ṭūrah, there is no light in Him. Could He be The Living Ṭūrah? I
believe He is. This would also mean, that anyone who draws you away from the Ṭūrah, or tries to persuade you to think
the Ṭūrah is no longer a light to us, than that teacher is a false teacher. Remember, there is only one teacher; that is
Mashýacḥ (MaṭhaṭhYahū/Matt 23:8). You cannot reject Ṭūrah and say you believe Mashýacḥ. Mashýacḥ and Ṭūrah agree;
one and the same, synonymous; identical in image through behavior and speech. One does not resist the other.

       Yahūshâ claims: ‫ יהושע‬said to him, “I am the Way, and the Truth, and the Life. No one comes to the Father
        except through Me.” Yahūcḥanan/Jn 14:6

    1. Dabarým/Deut 6:24 ‘And ‫ יהוה‬commanded us to do all these laws, to fear ‫ יהוה‬our Ålahým, for our good always,
       to keep us alive, as it is today.
    2. Dabarým/Deut6:25 ‘And it is righteousness for us when we guard to do all this command before ‫ יהוה‬our
       Ålahým, as He has commanded us.’

    3. Dabarým/Deut32:4 “The Rock! His work is perfect, for all His ways are Right-Ruling, An Ål of truth and
       without unrighteousness, Righteous and straight is He.

    4. Ṭahalým/Ps 119:142 Your righteousness is righteousness forever, And Your Ṭūrah is truth. (Ps 119:151)

    5. NacḥamYah/Neh 9:13 “And You came down on Mount Sýný, and spoke with them from the heavens, and gave
       them straight right-rulings and Ṭūrah of truth, good laws and commands.(NacḥamYah/Neh 9:33)

These five witnesses clearly tell us that Truth, Life, Righteousness, perfect works; straightness, and Ṭūrah are
interchangeable in the OT. Let’s get organized, and match these claims up:

       I am the Way: from G3598 – way/ὁδός – Hodos or odos and H1870 - way/‫ דרך‬Darak
        BDB definition for both Greek and Hebrew: manner; habit; way; course of life; moral character

        Looking for this word way Yahūshâ claimed to be, that matches the way of Yahūah in the OT:
        Shamūṭh/Ex 23:20: “...guard you in The Way...”
        Shamūṭh/Ex 33:13: “...show me now Your Way...”
        Dabarým/Deut 8:6: “...to walk in His Ways...”
        Dabarým/Deut 10:12; 11:22; 19:9; 26:17; 28:9; 30:16: “...fear Yahūah your Ålahým to walk in all His Ways; to
        love Him...”

        Turning aside from the way:
        Dabarým/Deut 9:12: “...they quickly turned aside out of The Way which I have commanded them...”
                                                                                                         Page 136 of 396

        Dabarým/Deut 11:28: “...If you do not obey, but turn aside from The Way...”
        Dabarým/Deut 28:68: “...by a Way I said to you,’You shall never see it again’...”
        Dabarým/Deut 31:29: “...utterly corrupt yourselves and turn aside from The Way which I have commanded...”

Dabarým/Deut 32:4 states that “all His Ways are Right-Ruling”. Yahūshâ claims to be “The Way”. This is a match.

       I am the Truth: from G225 – truth/ ἀλήθεια – Aletheia - meaning: what is true - from the G227- ἀληθής –
        Alethes - meaning: true; speaking the truth - from G1 – Alpha which is of Hebrew origin meaning: Ålaph/‫– א‬
        This would suggest He is claiming, the “truth” and “beginning” are one in the same. The ‫ את‬is a signature of The
        Word of Yahūah seen throughout the scriptures. The ‫ א‬represents the beginning, and the ‫ ת‬represents the end. The
        G227 has a second root: G2990 - λανθάνω – lanthano -meaning: to be hidden; secret. Is the truth hidden? (He is
        the beginning-Rev 1:8, 3:14, 21:6, 22:13)
        -   and H571 - truth/‫ אמת‬åmaṭh – meaning: firmness; stability; faithfulness – from H539 – åman/‫אמן‬
            meaning: to support; confirm; be faithful. We use this word at the end of our prayers. Learning the meaning of
            this word, should change the way we think and trust after we pray.

      Looking for this word truth Yahūshâ claimed to be, that matches the truth of Yahūah in the OT:
      Shamūṭh/Ex 34:6: “...abundant in goodness and truth...”
      Dabarým/Deut 32:4: “...A Mighty One of truth; without unrighteousness...”
      NacḥamYah/Neh 9:13: “...and gave them straight right-rulings and Ṭūrah of truth...”
      NacḥamYah/Neh 9:33: “...you have done truth, but we have done wrong.”
      Ṭahalým/Ps 25:5: “...lead me in your truth...”
      Ṭahalým/Ps 25:10: “...all the ways of Yahūah are kindness and truth...”
      Ṭahalým/Ps 43:3: “Send forth Your Light and Your truth.”
      Ṭahalým/Ps 86:11: “Teach me Your way Yahūah; let me walk in your truth...”
      Ṭahalým/Ps 111:7; 119:30: “The works of His hands are truth and right-ruling...”
      Ṭahalým/Ps 119:142, 151, 160; Yachazaqaʿål/Eze 18:9; Malʿåký/Mal 2:6-8: “...and Your Ṭūrah is truth.”
Ṭahalým/Ps 119:142 states that, “Your Ṭūrah is truth.” Yahūshâ claims to be The Truth. This is a match.

       I am the Life: from G2222 – life/ ζωή – Zoe - meaning: fullness of life; possessed of vitality – from G2198 –
        ζάω - Zao - meaning: to live breathe; be among the living and H2416 - life/‫ חי‬Cḥý meaning: living; alive; living
        thing – from H2421 – Cḥýah/‫ חיה‬meaning: to live; have life; to remain alive; to preserve alive

        Looking for this word life Yahūshâ claimed to be, that matches the life of Yahūah in the OT:
        Dabarým/Deut 30:15: “...I set before you today, life, and good and evil...”
        Dabarým/Deut 30:19: “...you shall choose life...”
        Dabarým/Deut 30:20: “...cling to Him, for He is your life, and the length of your days...”
        Dabarým/Deut 32:47: “...it is your life, and by this Word you prolong your days...”
        NacḥamYah/Neh 9:6: “...you give life to them all...”
        Ṭahalým/Ps 16:11: “...show me the way of life...”
        Ṭahalým/Ps 36:9: “...with You is the fountain of life...”
        Ṭahalým/Ps 119:93: “...Your orders have given me life...”
        Mashalý/Prov 6:23: “...the Ṭūrah is light, reproofs of instruction are the way of life...”

Dabarým/Deut 6:24 states that, ‘And ‫ יהוה‬commanded us to do all these laws, to fear ‫ יהוה‬our Ålahým, for our good
always, to preserve us alive.” Yahūshâ claims to be The life. This is a match. The Ṭūrah is The Way, The Truth, and The
life. Yahūshâ is The Teacher; The Living Ṭūrah. The Word of life was given from the beginning, and has been rejected to
this very day. Has He been telling His taught ones; that He is the Word that worked righteousness in the OT, but was “cut
off” from His people?
                                                                                                           Page 137 of 396

YashâYahū/Isa 53:7-12 He was oppressed and He was afflicted, but He did not open His mouth. He was led as a lamb to
the slaughter, and as a sheep before its shearers is silent, but He did not open His mouth. 8 He was taken from prison and
from judgment. And as for His generation, who considered that He shall be cut off from the land of the living? For the
transgression of My people He was stricken. 9He was appointed a grave with the wrong, and with the rich at His death,
because He had done no violence, nor was deceit in His mouth. 10But ‫ יהוה‬was pleased to crush Him. He laid sickness on
Him, that when He made Himself an offering for guilt, He would see a seed; He would prolong His days and the pleasure
of ‫ יהוה‬prosper in His hand. 11He would see the result of the suffering of His life and be satisfied. Through His knowledge
My righteous Servant makes many righteous, and He bears their crookedness. 12Therefore I give Him a portion among the
great, and He divides the spoil with the strong, because He poured out His being unto death, and He was counted with
the transgressors, and He bore the sin of many, and made intercession for the transgressors (Compare: YaramYahū11:19).

YashâYahū/Isa 59:14 And right-ruling is driven back, and righteousness stands far off. For truth has fallen in the street,
and right is unable to enter.

YaramYahū/Jer 23:5 “See, the days are coming,” declares ‫יהוה‬, “when I shall raise for Dūýd a Branch of
righteousness, and a Sovereign shall reign and act wisely, and shall do right-ruling and righteousness in the earth.

YaramYahū/Jer 23:6 “In His days Yahūdah shall be saved, and Yasharʿål dwell safely. And this is His Name whereby
He shall be called: ‘‫ יהוה‬our Righteousness.’ (Remember, Ps 110: 1-7; ‫צדך‬-‫ מלכי‬- “MLKÝ-TSDK” “My King is Righteous”
p. 134 )


          Yahūshâ claimed:“He who possesses My commands and guards them, it is he who loves Me. He who loves Me
           shall be loved by My Father. I shall love him and manifest Myself to him.” Yahūcḥanan/Jn 14:21) Clearly, there
           are two at work in this passage. (MathathYahu/Matt 12:47-50

Didn’t Yahūah say the same thing in the OT?
   1. Shamūṭh/Exod 20:6 but showing kindness to thousands, to those who love Me and guard My commands.

    2. Dabarým/Deut 6:5, 6 “And you shall love ‫ יהוה‬your Ålahým with all your heart, and with all your being, and
       with all your might. 6And these Words which I am commanding you today shall be in your heart...”

    3. Dabarým/Deut 7:9 “And you shall know that ‫ יהוה‬your Ålahým, He is Ålahým, the trustworthy Ål guarding
       covenant and kindness for a thousand generations with those who love Him, and those who guard His
       commands...”

    4. Dabarým/Deut 7:11-13 “And you shall guard the command, and the laws, and the right-rulings which I
       command you today, to do them. 12And it shall be, because you hear these right-rulings, and shall guard and do
       them, that ‫ יהוה‬your Ålahým shall guard with you the covenant and the kindness which He swore to your fathers,
       13
         and shall love you and favor you and increase you, and shall favor the fruit of your womb and the fruit of your
       land, your grain and your new wine and your oil, the increase of your cattle and the offspring of your flock, in the
       land of which He swore to your fathers to give you.”

    5. Dabarým/Deut 13:3, 4 Do not listen to the words of that nabýå or that dreamer of dreams, for ‫ יהוה‬your Ålahým
       is trying you to know whether you love ‫ יהוה‬your Ålahým with all your heart and with all your being. 4Walk after
       ‫ יהוה‬your Ålahým and fear Him, and guard His commands and obey His Voice, and serve Him and cling to
       Him.(Jn 15:14,15)

Yahūshâ also warns us about guarding these commands again in Cḥazūn/Rev 12:17, 14:12, 22:14. (Zeph 2:3)
                                                                                                            Page 138 of 396

       Yahūshâ claimed: MaṭhaṭhYahū/Matt 7:21 “Not everyone who says to Me, ‘Master, Master,’ shall enter into the
        reign of the heavens, but he who is doing the desire of My Father in the heavens. (MaṭhaṭYahū 5:19, 7:24; Luke
        8:21; 11:28; Mark 4:20)


What does the OT say about doing the desire or will of The Father?
    1. Yahūʿål/Joel 2:11 And ‫ יהוה‬shall give forth His Voice before His army, for His camp is very great, for mighty is
       the doer of His Word. For the day of ‫ יהוה‬is great and very terrifying, and who does bear it?


    2. Ṭahalým/Ps 111:1-10 Praise ‫ !יה‬I thank ‫ יהוה‬with all my heart; in the company of the straight, and of the
       congregation. 2Great are the works of ‫יהוה‬, searched for by all who delight in them. 3Splendour and greatness
       are His work, and His righteousness stands forever. 4He has made His wonders to be remembered; ‫ יהוה‬shows
       favor and is compassionate. 5He has given food to those who fear Him; He remembers His covenant forever. 6He
       has shown His people the power of His works, To give to them the inheritance of the gentiles. 7The works of His
       hands are truth and right-ruling. All His orders are trustworthy. 8They are upheld forever and ever; Performed in
       truth and straightness. 9He sent redemption to His people. He has commanded His covenant forever. Set-Apart
       and Terrifying is His Name. 10The fear of ‫ יהוה‬is the beginning of wisdom. All those doing them (His Right-
       Rulings in vs. 7) have a good understanding. His praise is standing forever.

    3. Dabarým/Deut 11:22 ‘For if you diligently guard all these commands which I command you, to do it, to love
       ‫ יהוה‬your Ålahým, to walk in all His Ways, and to cling to Him (James 1:22).”

    4. Dabarým/Deut 15:5 “...only if you diligently obey The Voice of ‫ יהוה‬your Ålahým, to guard to do all these
       Commands which I am commanding you today. (YashâYahū/Isa 44:8, 45:5, 45:21).

    5. Dabarým/Deut 28:15 “And it shall be, if you do not obey The Voice of ‫ יהוה‬your Ålahým, to guard to do all His
       Commands and His Laws which I command you today, that all these curses shall come upon you and overtake
       you (James 1:21, 2). There is only One Voice that comes from the mouth of Yahūah. His Word (Dabarým 8:3)

Looking back at Ṭahalým/Ps 111: 1-10, it becomes clear, that the works of “His” hands are the Ṭūrah. We learned previously
that Truth, Righteousness, Life and The Ṭūrah are interchangeable terms. Right-Ruling is also a term used for “Judgements”.
These terms are all referring to Ṭūrah. Verse nine states, “He sent redemption to His people.” The redemption sent was the
Ṭūrah they rejected. This Ṭūrah is the Word of Yahūah. Had they known how precious these words were, they would have
clung to them. This Ṭūrah has saving power in it because it is full of Life (Deut 32:47; James 1:21). He has been proclaiming
this from the very beginning. Do the command, and live (Ū Yaqrå/Lev 18:5; Mashalý/Prov 4:4, 7:2; Qhalaṭh/Ecc 12:13). Yahūah
rejects those who rejects this Ṭūrah (Dabarým/Deut 31:15-18, Mashlý/Prov 28:9). He even commands us to “choose Life” in
Dabarým/Deut 30:19: “I have called the heavens and the earth as witnesses today against you: I have set before you Life
and Death, The Barakah and the curse. Therefore you shall choose Life, so that you live, both you and your seed...”
Also, remember what Yahūshâ said, “I Am The Way, The Truth, and The Life. No one comes to The Father except through
Me.” Yahūcḥanan/Jn 14:6 (Prov 4:4, 7:2)
I think I have given enough evidence to prove Yahūshâ is the Word/Law/Ṭūrah, manifested in the flesh. This Word was
given in the Old Testament to rule and lead His people to long life, Peace and Right Standing with The Father. He gave The
Word to them to lead the rest of the nations to be a light to them; so the nations would say, “What a wise and understanding
people is this nation” (Dabarým/Deut 4:6). The Word, Yahūshâ, often spoke of His Father in the written accounts of His life.
There are two at work here: The Word sent from The Father, who is doing the work of The Father; and The Father. The
Word, who is Yahūshâ, and The Father are Ålahým. I discuss this title, “Ålahým” further in the next chapter.

This section can easily offend many. What most people cannot see or understand, is that The Word of Yahūah is The One
who dealt with the House of Yasharʿål from the very beginning. Yet, all of us understand, the Mashýacḥ spoke of His
Father. Also, we understand that Mashah (Moses) wrote about Mashýacḥ. If The Word of Yahūah is sent to earth, then
the Father still remains in the Heavens: Yahūah above, and Yahūah is on the earth; through His Word. Yet no one has
seen The Father according to Yahūcḥanan/John 6:46. Man has only seen what The Father brought forth from His mouth:
The Word; which was spoken, written and manifested in the flesh. The Word of The Father has been dealing with
mankind, to get him prepared, and ready to stand before The Father; so that he will not perish in His Wrath. This Word
sent, is the image and salvation of The Father; in the form of Commandments and Right-Rulings. We reject His image, by
refusing the instructions given to us, in the form of the words/instructions given by Yahūah. Give yourself over to those
words, and you have given yourself over to The Image of The Father. Following Yahūshâ, and His behavior and
instruction, will reveal what that image is. Guarding The Commands and Right-Rulings of Yahūah is embracing The
Father. In Yahūcḥanan/John 5:47, Yahūshâ said, “For if you believed Mashah, you would have believed Me, since he
wrote about Me.” I believe it was The Word of Yahūah who spoke to Mashah in the burning bush; He steered a multitude
out of Matsarým, across the Red Sea; and gave a list of instructions to that same multitude to be an example for all the
nations.

In Yahūcḥanan/John 14:9, Yahūshâ said, “Have I been with you so long, and you have not known Me, Philip? He who
has seen Me has seen the Father, and how do you say, ‘Show us the Father’? But wait, He says something interesting
again in Yahūcḥanan/John 6:46: “Not that anyone has seen the Father except the one who is from Yahūah – He has seen
the Father.” And again in verse 57, “Just as the living Father sent Me, and I live because of the Father, so the one who
consumes Me will live because of Me.”(Dabarým 8:3 tells us every word from the mouth of Yahūah is to be consumed (obeyed).

In Shamūṭh/Ex 3:14, it is said, “I am that which I am.” And He said, “Thus you shall say to the children of Yasharʿål, ‘I
am has sent me to you.’ ” In Yahūcḥanan/John 8:58, Yahūshâ said to them, “Truly, truly, I say to you, before Åbraham
came to be, I am.” And yet again, “For I have not spoken from my own authority, but the Father Himself who sent Me has
commanded Me what I should say and what I should speak.” Yahūcḥanan/John 12:47-49. Clearly, there are two here.
He is the Word of The Father. 1. FATHER 2. WORD

It was The Word that did the work of creating the earth. It was The Word who led Åbraham, Yatscḥaq, and Yʿâqb. It was
the Word that came forth to draw a multitude out of Matsarým. It was The Word that was brought forth consistently to
His people, through the Nabýå; begging them to stop discarding and butchering those instructions given to them. This
was meant to prepare and dress them; so they would be received by The Father, and then the rest of the nations would
have followed suit. It was The Word that was sent forth; manifested in the flesh, begging His people again and again, to
stop discarding The Word; which is the image of The Father. Yahūah wanted His people to embrace His Word, so that
His Word could save them from His Wrath; coming from the curses promised to them within the covenant. Just as this
same people butchered and discarded The Word sent forth; in the form of instructions, they now had ample opportunity to
tear The Image of The Father (The fullness of Right-Ruling) to pieces in the form of flesh, and watch that image bleed.
They could finally touch what they have been hating from the very beginning, for so long. They showed The Father how
they really felt about those Commands (Yahūcḥanan/Jn 15:24). Disdain for The Law/Ṭūrah, is disdain for The Word.
Disdain for The Word, is disdain for the Father. The Law or The Word, is The Image of The Father.

The following, is something I believe some will find curious: if you have ears to hear. Others may find it offensive and
refuse to study it out. We all have been told so many lies, and have built for ourselves a default, we immediately fall prey
to as our safe place. Nobody wants to be deceived or tricked. Yet, I find within this age of darkness, that has swallowed
up the inhabitants of the earth in these last days; many of those who fear being misled, refuse to come out of the darkness
they live in, given to them by their fathers. Darkness is that which does not agree with The Word that was given from the
                                                                                                         Page 140 of 396

beginning. I have been learning some things about our English translation. I am compelled to share what I have been
learning about this subject. Carefully observe the following passages.

Hear O Yasharʿål: Yahūah our Ålahým; Yahūah is One! (Dabarým/Deut 6:4). Has this passage of scripture been translated
correctly? If there were any evidence to the contrary, would we believe what the message is in the text given by Yahūah
from the beginning, or would we discard it because it would not fit the tradition we are so used to? How do we really
view the Word of Yahūah? Are we not hearing Him at all? After the following passages have been absorbed, I will share
what has been given to me about Dabarým/Deut 6:4. Then you can decide for yourself whether there are two at work as
opposed to one.

        The following list of scriptures, will certainly cause one to stop and ponder: Ålahým, The Mighty Ones.


        B-rʿåshýṭh/Gen 1:26 And Ålahým/‫( אלהים‬Mighty Ones) said, “Let Us make man in Our image, according to Our
        likeness, and let them rule over the fish of the sea, and over the birds of the heavens, and over the livestock,
        and over all the earth and over all the creeping creatures that creep on the earth.”
        B-rʿåshýṭh/Gen 1:27 So Ålahým/‫( אלהים‬Mighty Ones) created man in His own image, in the image of
        Ålahým/‫( אלהים‬Mighty Ones) He created him; male and female He created them.
        B-rʿåshýṭh/Gen 3:22 And Yahūah/‫ יהוה‬Ålahým/‫ אלהים‬said, “See, the man has become like one of Us, to know
        good and evil. And now, lest he put out his hand and take also of the tree of life, and eat, and live forever...”
        B-rʿåshýṭh/Gen 11:6, 7 And Yahūah/‫ יהוה‬said, “Look, they are one people and they all have one language, and
        this is what they begin to do! And now, they are not going to be withheld from doing whatever they plan to do.
        7
         Come, let Us go there and confuse their language, so that they do not understand one another’s speech.”
        B-rʿåshýṭh/Gen 19:24 And Yahūah/‫( יהוה‬Yahūah on earth) rained Sulphur and fire on Sadam and Åmarah, from
        Yahūah/‫ יהוה‬out of the heavens.
        Shamūṭh/Ex 9:5 And Yahūah/‫ יהוה‬set an appointed time, saying, “Tomorrow, Yahūah/‫ יהוה‬is going to do this
        word in the land.”
        Shamūṭh/Ex 19:10,11 And Yahūah/‫ יהוה‬said unto Mashah, “Go unto the people, and make them Set-Apart
        today and tomorrow, and let them wash their clothes, and be ready against the third day; for the third day
        Yahūah/‫ יהוה‬will come down in the sight of all the people upon mount Sýný.” (The Father speaks, The Word works)
        Shamūṭh/Ex 19:21 And Yahūah/‫ יהוה‬said unto Mashah, “Go down, charge the people, lest they break through
        unto Yahūah/‫ יהוה‬to gaze, and many of them perish.”
        Shamūṭh/Ex 19:22 “And let the Kahaným also, which come near to Yahūah/‫יהוה‬, set themselves apart, lest
        Yahūah/‫ יהוה‬break forth upon them.”
        Shamūṭh/Ex 19:24 And Yahūah/‫ יהוה‬said unto him, “Away, get down, and you shalt come up, you, and Åharan
        with you; but let not the Kahaným and the people break through to come up unto Yahūah/‫יהוה‬, lest He break
        forth upon them.”
        Shamūṭh/Ex 34:5 And Yahūah/‫ יהוה‬descended in the cloud, and stood with him there, and proclaimed The
        Name of Yahūah/‫יהוה‬.
        Shamūṭh/Ex 34:6 And Yahūah/‫ יהוה‬passed by before him, and proclaimed, “Yahūah/‫יהוה‬, Yahūah/‫ יהוה‬-
        Ål/‫אל‬, (mighty one) Merciful and Kind, Longsuffering, and abundant in Goodness and Truth…” (The Word is
        speaking about His Father’s Name and character here.)
        B-madbar/Num 25:4 And Yahūah/‫ יהוה‬said unto Mashah, “Take all the heads of the people, and hang them up
        before Yahūah/‫ יהוה‬against the sun, that The Fierce Anger of Yahūah/‫ יהוה‬may be turned away from
        Yasharʿål.”
        B-madbar/Num 11:23 And Yahūah/‫ יהוה‬said unto Mashah, “Is Yahūah/‫ יהוה‬hand waxed short? You will see
        now whether My Word shall come to pass unto you or not.”
                                                                                                   Page 141 of 396

B-madbar/Num 18:19 All the heave offerings of the Set-Apart things, which the children of Yasharʿål offer unto
Yahūah/‫יהוה‬, have I given thee, and thy sons and thy daughters with thee, by a Statute forever: it is a Covenant
of Salt for ever before Yahūah/‫ יהוה‬unto thee and to thy seed with thee.
Dabarým/Deut 5:5 I stood between Yahūah/‫ יהוה‬and you at that time, to show you The Word of Yahūah/‫יהוה‬:
for ye were afraid by reason of the fire, and went not up into the mount; saying…”
Dabarým/Deut 6:4 Hear, Yasharʿål: Yahūah/‫ יהוה‬Ålahýnū/‫( אלהינו‬our Mighty Ones), Yahūah/‫ יהוה‬only!
Shamūʿål Ålaph/1 Sam 3:7 Now Shamūʿål did not yet know Yahūah/‫יהוה‬, neither was The Word of
Yahūah/‫ יהוה‬yet revealed unto him.
Shamūʿål Ålaph/1 Sam 3:21 And Yahūah/‫ יהוה‬appeared again in Shalah: for Yahūah/‫ יהוה‬revealed himself to
Shamū`ål in Shalah by The Word of Yahūah/‫יהוה‬.
Shamūʿål Ålaph /1Sam 16:7 But Yahūah/‫ יהוה‬said unto Shamūʿål, Look not on his countenance, or on the
height of his stature; because I have refused him: for not as man sees; for man looks on the outward
appearance, but Yahūah/‫ יהוה‬looks on the heart.
Malakým Býṭh/2Kgs 9:26 “Surely I have seen yesterday the blood of Nabūṭh, and the blood of his sons, saith
Yahūah/‫ ;יהוה‬and I will requite thee in this plat, saith Yahūah/‫יהוה‬. Now therefore take and cast him into the
plat of ground, according to The Word of Yahūah/‫יהוה‬.”
Malakým Býṭh/1Kgs 17:14 For thus saith Yahūah/‫ יהוה‬Ålahý/‫( אלהי‬Mighty Ones) of Yasharʿål, “The barrel of
meal shall not waste, neither shall the cruse of oil fail, until the day that Yahūah/‫ יהוה‬sends rain upon the
earth.”
Malakým Býṭh/2Kgs 20:5 “Turn again, and tell CḥazaqYahū the captain of my people, “Thus says Yahūah/‫יהוה‬,
Ålahý/‫( אלהי‬Mighty Ones) of Dūd your father, I have heard your prayer, I have seen your tears: behold, I will
heal you: on the third day you shall go up to The House of Yahūah/‫יהוה‬.”
YaramYahū/Jer 14:10 Thus saith Yahūah/‫ יהוה‬unto this people, “They loved to wander, they have not refrained
their feet, therefore Yahūah/‫ יהוה‬doth not accept them; he will now remember their iniquity, and visit their
sins.
YaramYahū/Jer 26:2 Thus saith Yahūah/‫יהוה‬, “Stand in the court of Yahūah/‫ יהוה‬House, and speak unto all the
cities of Yahūdah, which come to worship in Yahūah/‫ יהוה‬House, all The Words that I Command you to speak
to them; diminish not a word…”
YaramYahū/Jer 31:38 Behold, the days come, saith Yahūah/‫יהוה‬, that the city shall be built to Yahūah/‫יהוה‬
from the tower of Cḥanan`ål unto the gate of the corner.
YaramYahū/Jer 33:2 Thus saith Yahūah/‫ יהוה‬the maker thereof, Yahūah/‫ יהוה‬that formed it, to establish it;
Yahūah/‫ יהוה‬is His Name…”
YaramYahū/Jer 34:12 Therefore, The Word of Yahūah/‫ יהוה‬came to YaramYahū from Yahūah/‫יהוה‬, saying…”
Yacḥazaq`ål/Ezek 44:5 And Yahūah/‫ יהוה‬said unto me, Son of man, mark well, and behold with thine eyes, and
hear with thine ears all that I say unto thee concerning all The Ordinances of The House of Yahūah/‫יהוה‬, and all
The Laws thereof; and mark well the entering in of The House, with every going forth of The Sanctuary.
Hūshâ/Hos 1:2 The beginning of The Word of Yahūah/‫ יהוה‬by Hūshâ. And Yahūah/‫ יהוה‬said to Hūshâ, “Go,
take yourself a woman of whoring and children of whoring, for the land has utterly whored away from
Yahūah/‫יהוה‬.”
Hūshâ/Hos 3:1 Then Yahūah/‫ יהוה‬said to me, “Go again, love a woman loved by a friend, and an adulteress,
according to The Love of Yahūah/‫ יהוה‬for the children of Yasharʿål, though they are turning to other mighty
ones and love their raisin cakes.”
                                                                                                           Page 142 of 396

        Âmūs/Amos 2:4 Thus said Yahūah/‫יהוה‬, “For three transgressions of Yahūdah, and for four, I do not turn it
        back, because they have rejected the Ṭūrah of Yahūah/‫יהוה‬, and did not guard His Laws. And their lies after
        which their fathers walked lead them astray.
        Âmūs/Amos 8:11 “See, days are coming,” declares the Master Yahūah/‫יהוה‬, “that I shall send a hunger in the
        land, not a hunger for bread, nor a thirst for water, but for hearing The Word of Yahūah/‫יהוה‬.
        ZakarYah/Zech 3:2 And Yahūah/‫ יהוה‬said to Shatan, (adversary) “Yahūah/‫ יהוה‬rebuke you, Shatan!
        Yahūah/‫ יהוה‬who has chosen Yarūshalam rebuke you! Is this not a brand plucked from the fire?”
        ZakarYah/Zech 6:12 “…and shall speak to him, saying, ‘Thus said Yahūah/‫ יהוה‬Tsabʿåŭṭh, saying, “See, the Man
        whose Name is The Branch! And from His place He shall branch out, and He shall build the Hýkal of
        Yahūah/‫יהוה‬.
        ZakarYah/Zech 10:12 “And I shall strengthen them in Yahūah/‫יהוה‬, so that they walk up and down in His
        Name,” declares Yahūah/‫יהוה‬.
        ZakarYah/Zech 14:9 And Yahūah/‫ יהוה‬shall be Sovereign over all the earth. In that day there shall be only
        Yahūah/‫יהוה‬, and His Name only. (The Word is always speaking about His Father to man.)

                                       The Father and His Word: Ålahým
                                              Yahūah and Yahūshâ
   The Word of Yahūah has been The Salvation of His people, since The Word was given. Do the Command, and The
                  Command will save you! Love The Command, and it will circumcise your heart!



          Hear O Yasharʿål: Yahūah our Ålahým; Yahūah is ‫אחד‬/One? (Dabarým/Deut 6:4). Let’s look at this.
To hear what Yahūah is declaring, is to first choose a heart that will give in to what He is saying to us, through these
Commands. The Hebrew word for hear is the H8085, ‫שמע‬. I have currently been doing a study on this word, and its
contextual use throughout the scriptures with a brother who has many years of etymological, and in-depth research on
linguistics regarding this subject matter. The results of his research amazed me. I was shocked at what he uncovered. Let
me first urge you students to seek out this study on the word hear or shmâ. Without a heart to hear/obey, you will never
understand what Yahūah is saying. Obeying is the act of hearing or listening. Let’s see how studying the act of obeying
or listening, can reveal unexpected treasures to the first time student of the scriptures.

If you recall in Shamūʿål Ålaph/1Sam 8:4-7, Yahūah is not pleased with His people, because they want a king. Why? The
rest of the nations were doing this. So, what was the problem? Why didn’t Yahūah want His people to set up their rule,
with a man for a king? It is clear Yahūah is offended at this whole idea (Shamūʿål Ålaph/1Sam 12:17-25). I want to review
the time where Mashah received the Laws of Yahūah. But before I do, I want to take a look at the word åcḥad/‫אחד‬,
which is the target word in the scripture above in red, translated as the number one (1) in the English; or so we have been
led to believe.

From the BDB:
Original: ‫אחד‬
- Transliteration: åcḥad
- Phonetic: ach-awd
- Definition:
1. one (number)
a. one (number)
b. each, every
c. a certain
d. an (indefinite article)

e. only, once, once for all
f. one...another, the one...the other, one after another, one by one
g. first
h. eleven (in combination), eleventh (ordinal)
Now consider synonymous terminology:
Synonyms:
one-cardinal
1 each one is loosely wrapped: unit, item; technical monad.
2 only one person came: a single, a solitary, a sole, a lone.
3 her one concern was her daughter: "only", single, solitary, sole, exclusive.

As I began to realize what this brother had uncovered, I started to understand that this passage of scripture could not be
translated in its traditional form contextually. Why? Because, Yahūah has consistently told His people and declared over
and over again, to listen or obey; heed or hear, His word and His word only. So, what does this have to do with what
happened in Shamūʿål chapter 8, and what happened on the mountain? Well let’s go to Dabarým/Deut 5:23-29 and find
out.

Dabarým 5:23 “And  it came to be, when you heard the Voice from the midst of the darkness, while the mountain was
burning with fire, that you came near to me, all the heads of your tribes and your elders,
Dabarým 5:24 andsaid, ‘See, ‫ יהוה‬our Ålahým has shown us His esteem and His greatness, and we have heard His Voice
from the midst of the fire. Today we have seen that Ålahým speaks with man – and he lives!
Dabarým 5:25 ‘And  now why should we die? For this great fire is consuming us. If we hear The Voice of ‫ יהוה‬our Ålahým
any more, then we shall die. Compare: Shamūṭh/Ex 20:19- they did not want to hear from Yahūah, but from Mashah.
Dabarým 5:26 ‘For who is there of all flesh who has heard The Voice of The Living Ålahým speaking from the midst of the
fire, as we have, and does live?
Dabarým 5:27 ‘Yougo near and hear all that ‫ יהוה‬our Ålahým says, and speak to us all that ‫ יהוה‬our Ålahým says to you,
and we shall hear and do it.’
Dabarým 5:28 “And  ‫ יהוה‬heard the voice of your words when you spoke to me, and ‫ יהוה‬said to me, ‘I have heard the voice
of the words of this people which they have spoken to you. They have done well in all that they have spoken.
Dabarým 5:29 ‘Oh, that they had such a heart in them, to fear Me and to guard all My Commands always, so that it might be
well with them and with their children forever!

I want to share with you what this brother shared with me about verse 28:
         “If you are reading it in the Åbarý (Hebrew) correctly, applying the rules that they have put in place
 [e.g. the ha (‫) ה‬prefixed at the beginning of the statement], you will see a different picture being painted. Yahūah is
  actually asking if they have done well in all that they spoke, which is why the next sentence He says, ‘If only they
                                had a heart to fear Me and guard all My Commands…’”

Now, look at what The Most High is actually trying to convey. The heart of Yahūah wanted those people to hear and
listen or have the heart to obey His Commands...listening to Him directly was part of those Commands! In other words,
He would not have given the people a statement of disappointment had they spoken well. This is an excellent point. What
does Shamūʿål chapter 8 have to do with this? Yahūah was upset because the people wanted to have a man as sovereign,
and not Him. They did not have a heart to want to listen to Yahūah directly. They wanted to listen to a man instead. Just
like the situation that occurred on the mountain. It is clear in verse 28 of Dabarým, that Yahūah was upset here as well.
The people did not do well; by not wanting to listen to Yahūah. This brother continues to explain:

“When considering all the places He directed them to shmâ/‫( שמע‬listen) His Voice and applying the rules of Åbarý
(Hebrew) grammar; as well as keeping the context of what He has said from the beginning, we can see something very
different here. His question leaves one to wonder if they had done right by desiring to shmâ/‫( שמע‬listen) to Mashah, as
                                                                                                                      Page 144 of 396

opposed to listening to His Voice directly as He spoke to them. Suggesting this notion is extremely controversial in many
ideologies. But, has ideology esteemed man over Yahūah?” –“Turn Back! But How?” by Mal`akYahu p. 35

Now, let us translate Dabarým/Deut 6:4 in context with what Yahūah is saying to His people with regards to hearing.
                  Hear O Yasharʿål: Yahūah our Ålahým; Yahūah only! (Compare: ZakarYah/Zech 14:9)
Using Dabarým/Deut 6:4 as an argument against The view of Ålahým as two beings (The Father and The Word) rather
than one, is like putting a milk bucket under a bull. It just does not fit when reading the passage in context. This passage is
telling Yasharʿål to listen to His Voice only. Now, what about these passages:

Dabarým/Deut 32:39 ‘See now that I, I am He, And there is no Ålahým besides Me. I put to death and I make alive. I have wounded,
and I heal. And from My hand no one delivers! There is no other mighty ones’s voice to listen to.

YashâYahū/Isa 44:8 ‘Do
                    not fear, nor be afraid. Have I not since made you hear, and declared it? You are My witnesses. Is there an
Ålūah besides Me? There is no other Rock, I know not one.’ ” There is no other single mighty ones’s voice to listen to.

YashâYahū/Isa 45:5 ‘I   am ‫יהוה‬, and there is none else – there is no Ålahým besides Me. I gird you, though you have not known Me.

YashâYahū/Isa 45:21 “Declare    and bring near, let them even take counsel together. Who has announced this from of old? Who has
declared it from that time? Is it not I, ‫ ?יהוה‬And there is no mighty one besides Me, a Righteous Ål and a Savior, there is none
besides Me. The Father is a Mighty One. His Word is a Savior.


MaṭhaṭhYahū/Matt 27:46 And about the ninth hour ‫ יהושע‬cried out with a loud voice, saying, “Ěli, Ěli, lemah shebaqtani?” that is, “My
Ål, My Ål, why have You forsaken Me?” “My Mighty One, (Father) Why have you forsaken me?”

Yahūcḥanan/Jn 8:54 ‫יהושע‬ answered, “If I esteem Myself, My esteem is none at all. It is My Father who esteems Me, of whom you say
that He is your Ålahým. They have no understanding of “Alahym” because they are rejecting the Word in the flesh.


Yahūcḥanan/Jn 20:17 ‫יהושע‬  said to her, “Do not hold on to Me, for I have not yet ascended to My Father. But go to My brothers and
say to them, ‘I am ascending to My Father and your Father, and to My Ålahým and your Ålahým.’ ”

If there is none beside Him, then how do we explain the Mashýacḥ; one who is worshipped (Yahūcḥanan/Jn 20:28), while
calling on His Father to “let this cup pass from me” during His anguish in the garden (MaṭhaṭhYahū/Matt 26:39)? I want to
look at Ålūah. The BDB gives it this definition:
Ålūah/‫ אלוה‬from H433 (god) and comes from the H430: Ål/‫ אל‬meaning mighty one.

To translate anything and everything relating to Ål or Ålahým as “God” is reckless. God has a specific meaning and a
specific usage in the text. This is explained in section four. Now, about Yahūcḥanan/Jn 20:17; if Yahūshâ is speaking
about His Father, it becomes clear after careful study, that the translation should read; “my mighty one”, and not “my
Ålahým’ (Yahūcḥanan 8:42). Remember also, Ålahým has replaced The Name of “Yahūah” in many places within the text.
When Yahūah said, there is none beside me, that was Ålahým pleading with His people. The Word is sent forth from The
Father (Shamūṭh 15:7; Shamūʿål Býṭh 22:14; Ṭahalým18:13; YashâYahū 55:11; Yahūcḥanan 8:42, 17:8; Luke 12:49, 50). This
means they (Yasharʿål) have no other teacher but The Word sent from The Father (Matt 23:8). There is no other mighty
one to hear but Him only (Dabarým 5:24; 6:4). The Word speaks The Fathers Words. There is only one place where truth
and life comes from, and that is The Mouth of The Father. Yahūshâ said He was The Truth and The Life (Yahūcḥanan
14:6). The Word has always been their savior. The Word has always been their leader, their defender, their teacher (Åýūb
36:22; Ṭahalým 25:4; 84:5, 6; 119:26, 99; YashâYahū 30:20-28; Yahūʿål 2:23; MaṭhaṭhYahū 23:8), sent by The Father (Matt
23:8-12). In addition, The Word of Yahūah has all too often, been rejected by His people. This is why they could not wait
to kill Him when they saw the fullness of the Ṭūrah face to face. The Word of Yahūah prepares men’s hearts to be worthy
of The Fathers presence. The Word only does what The Father instructs (Yahūcḥanan 5:19, 8:28 12:49).Without this
intensive, long and drawn out plan of preparation from The Word He sent to us, all of us would be destroyed. Yet, only a
few will walk this path (MaṭhaṭhYahū 7:13, 14).

          All of creation is the army of Yahūah. This includes everything above the earth; below it, and everything in it!

         Shamūʿål Ålaph/1Sam 1:11 And she made a vow and said, “ Yahūah/‫ יהוה‬Tsabʿåŭṭh/‫צבאות‬, (army of
         resources”) You would indeed look on the affliction of your female servant and remember me, and not forget
         your female servant, but shall give your female servant a male child, then I shall give him to Yahūah/‫ יהוה‬all the
         days of his life, and let no razor come upon his head.”
         Shamūʿål Ålaph/1Sam 4:4 And the people sent to Shalah, and they brought from there the ark of the covenant
         of Yahūah/‫ יהוה‬Tsabʿåŭṭh/‫( צבאות‬army of resources), dwelling between the karabým. And the two sons of Âlý,
         Cḥaphaný and Pýnacḥas, were there with the ark of the covenant of Ålahým.
         Shamūʿål Ålaph/1Sam 15:2“Thus said Yahūah/‫ יהוה‬Tsabʿåŭṭh/‫( צבאות‬army of resources), ‘I shall punish
         Âmalaq for what he did to Yashar`ål, how he set himself against him on the way when he came up from
         Matsarým.
         Shamūʿål Ålaph/1Sam 17:45 But Dūd said to the Palashaṭhý, “You come to me with a sword, and with a spear,
         and with a javelin. But I come to you in The Name of Yahūah/‫ יהוה‬Tsabʿåŭṭh/‫( צבאות‬army of resources), the
         Ålahým of the armies of Yashar`ål, whom you have reproached.
         Shamūʿål Ålaph/2Sam 5:10 Dūd became great, and Yahūah/‫ יהוה‬Ålahým Tsabʿåŭṭh/‫( צבאות‬army of resources)
         was with him.
         Shamūʿål Ålaph/2Sam 6:2 And Dūd rose up and went with all the people who were with him from B῾âlý
         Yahūdah, to bring up from there the ark of Ålahým, that is called by The Name, The Name Yahūah/‫יהוה‬
         Tsabʿåŭṭh/‫( צבאות‬army of resources), who dwells between the karabým.
         Mal`åký/Mal 1:14 But cursed be the deceiver, which hath in his flock a male, and vowed, and sacrificed to
         Ådaný (My Master) a corrupt thing: for I am a great King, saith Yahūah/‫ יהוה‬Tsabʿåŭṭh/‫( צבאות‬army of
         resources). My Name is dreadful among the heathen.
         Malakým Býṭh/2Kgs 3:14 And ÅlYashâ said, “As Yahūah/‫ יהוה‬Tsabʿåŭṭh/‫( צבאות‬army of resources) lives, before
         whom I stand, if it were not that I regard the presence of Yahūshaphat sovereign of Yehūdah, I would not look
         at you nor see you.
         Ṭahalým/Ps 46:7 Yahūah/‫ יהוה‬Tsabʿåŭṭh/‫( צבאות‬army of resources) is with us; The Ålahým of Y῾âqb is our
         refuge. Salah. (In the “Aleppo” and the “Westminster Leningrad Codex” this passage is numbered as verse 8)
         Ṭahalým/Ps 48:8 As we have heard, so we have seen In the city of Yahūah/‫ יהוה‬Tsabʿåŭṭh/‫( צבאות‬army of
         resources), In the city of *Ålahýnū/‫( אלהינו‬our Ålahým), Ålahým establishes her forever. Selah. (In the “Aleppo”

         YashâYahū/Isa 1:9 Unless Yahūah/‫ יהוה‬Tsabʿåŭṭh/‫( צבאות‬army of resources) had left to us a small remnant, we
         would have become like Sadam, we would have been made like Âmarah.
         YaramYahū/Jer 8:3 “And death shall be preferred to life by all the rest of those who remain of this evil people,
         who remain in all the places where I have driven them,” declares Yahūah/‫ יהוה‬Tsabʿåŭṭh/‫( צבאות‬army of
         resources).
         Âmūs/Amos 3:13 “Hear and witness against the house of Y`âqb,” declares the Master *Yahūah/‫ יהוה‬, the
         Ålahým of Tsabʿåŭṭh/‫( צבאות‬army of resources).

 *Ålahýnū/‫( אלהינו‬our Ålahým) – is an example of a conjugated form of Ålahým/‫( – אלהים‬see p. 132) Their, our, my, his, are used to
translate the standard used which is Ålahým: his Ålahým, our Ålahým etc. I rarely use the conjugated forms in section 3.

Section 4: Chap 1




This section lists the many ways Bʿâl/‫ בעל‬is used in the scriptures. It is transliterated as “Baal”, and means possessor or
“LORD.” The meaning of the name of Bʿâl/‫ בעל‬is used as a replacement for The Name of The Father, Yahūah/ ‫יהוה‬. I
have collected all of the uses of this name or title of Bʿâl/‫ בעל‬as I could find with “Strong’s” numbers and their
definitions. On page 34, it is explained that names are transliterated preserving the sound of the letters as they are
written. The next step is to transfer these sounds into the target language from its source language. This fundamental rule
has been grossly violated, and has since become common practice by the scribes between the fifth and eighth century.
This same practice has been followed by a plethora of scholars, it has been embedded into all our study materials, and
now the layperson of every belief system in the earth today has been misled to follow suit. Needless to say, this list should
give anyone a fair supply of ammunition to tell the difference between the four letter Name of Yahūah/ ‫ יהוה‬and the three
letter name of Bʿâl/‫בעל‬.

Key:
All definitions in this list are taken from the “Brown-Driver-Briggs Hebrew and English Lexicon” in “The Word” Software.
I put a line through any word taken from the “BDB” transliterated incorrectly with the correct spelling following it. Example: Baal/Bʿâl
“The “KJV” translates “Strong’s” H--- in the following manner” is taken from “blueletterbible.com” throughout this entire list.
(Total --x) is how many times the word in question is used in the scriptures.
Refer to “Diacritic Chart” on p. 8 for pronunciation assistance of transliterated Hebrew words.

                                      Yahūah/‫ יהוה‬has something to say about THE LORD:
  YaramYahū/Jer 23:25-27 25 “I have heard what the nabýʿåým said, that fortell lies in My Name, saying, I have dreamed, I have
dreamed. 26 How long shall [this] be in the heart of the nabýå that fortell lies? Yes, [they are] nabýå of the deceit of their own heart;
 27 Which think to cause My people to forget My Name by their dreams which they tell every man to his neighbor, as their fathers

                                               have forgotten ‫ את‬My Name for Bʿâl/ ‫בעל‬.
    1. H1166     -‫בעל‬- Definition: Baal/Bʿâl - to marry, rule over, (possess), own - Origin: a primitive root
The KJV translates “Strong’s” H1166 in the following manner: marry (8x), husband (3x), dominion (2x), wife (1x), married
wife (1x), Beulah (1x). (Total 16x)



    2. H1167 ‫ בעל‬Definition: Baal/Bʿâl - owner, husband, lord (possessor) - Origin: from H1166
                 -     -
The KJV translates “Strong’s” H1167 in the following manner: man (25x), owner (14x), husband (11x), have (7x),
master (5x), man given (2x), adversary (1x), archers (1x), babbler (with H3956) (1x), bird (with H3671) (1x), captain (1x),
confederate (with H1285) (1x), misc (12x). (Total 82x)

        Ṭahalým/Ps 24:1 The earth belongs to ‫יהוה‬, and all that fills it – The world and those who dwell in it.

The psalmist does not replace His Name with Bʿâl, nor should we. His Name is clearly seen in the Hebrew. Replacing
His Name with another or replacing His Name with a title, is not how we were instructed to guard His Name. This means

Section 4: Chap 1a

  Now, let’s look at a passage that is deceptive. Keep an eye open to the reference numbers, and their origins as well as
         error entries, to the “Brown - Driver - Briggs Hebrew and English Lexicon”. Can you spot all of them?

                                Here are two passages of scripture without “Strong’s” reference numbers.
NET:
1Tim 6:14 “...to  obey this command without fault or failure until the appearing of our Lord Jesus Christ.”
1Tim 6:15 –   “...whose appearing the blessed and only Sovereign, the King of kings and Lord of lords, will reveal at the right time.”

                                   Here are the same two scriptures with “Strong’s” reference numbers.

Section 4: Chap 2

As stated in the previous section, the fundamental rule of transliterating our Creators Name from Hebrew to English has
been grossly violated. Lord, is not the only ploy used to cover or replace His Name. God is another name, or title, that
has been thrown into the mix of replacements for The Name of Yahūah/‫יהוה‬. With only four different Hebrew reference
numbers, making my job less laborious, and identified by two Hebrew characters, I have copied and pasted this
information for the new student, who may not have access to study materials. Reading over this list, I don’t imagine,
would be too agonizing to tell the difference between The Name of Yahūah/‫ יהוה‬and God/Gad/G-D/‫גד‬.

Key:
All definitions in this list are taken from the “Brown-Driver-Briggs Hebrew and English Lexicon” in The Word Software.
I put a line through any word taken from the BDB transliterated incorrectly with the correct spelling following it. Example: Jacob/Yʿâqb
“The KJV translates “Strong’s” H--- in the following manner” is taken from “blueletterbible.com” throughout this entire list
(Total --x) is how many times the word is used in the scriptures.
Refer to “Diacritic Chart” on p. 8 for pronunciation assistance of transliterated Hebrew words.


                                          Yahūah/‫ יהוה‬has something to say about God:

H1410    -‫ גד‬-Definition: Gad = "troop"         1. seventh son of Jacob/Yʿâqb by Zilpah/zalphah, Leah's/Låʿah handmaid, and full brother
of Asher/Åshr.

2. the tribe descended from Gad 3. a prophet during the time of David/Dūýd; appears to have joined David/Dūýd when in the hold;
reappears in connection with the punishment for taking a census; also assisted in the arrangements for the musical service of the
"House of God/Alahým" - Origin: from          H1464: 1. to invade, attack - Origin: a primitive root [akin to H1413]

                                        Here’s a shocker! God is not ‫ יהוה‬and ‫ יהוה‬is not God!
                A challenge for the student: find one Hebrew passage of scripture where ‫ יהוה‬refers to Himself as ‫גד‬.
                    It would look like this in the Hebrew: ‫ אני גד‬or ‫ – שמי גד‬meaning: “I am god” or “My name, god”

                        Now, let’s play a game. I will present a riddle for you-- see if you can solve it.


                                                          LET’S PLAY!

  B-rʿåshýṭh/Gen 1:1 In   the beginning            God           created                the heaven           and          the earth

The above passage is well known, and even children in Christian circles know of it. The English translation of the above
            passage is called the target language. It says that God is the creator of heaven and the earth.
                  Below, I have inserted the same passage in Hebrew. This is the source language.
                      I have included the reference numbers to assist you in solving the riddle.

 The only way to win this game is to not find any matches, at all. If God and LORD cannot be found where we were led to
believe they were; in the source language, then why are they present in the target language to begin with? That my friend,
  is the mother of all questions. If we can find this deliberate deception over and over again in the Old Testament, then
          wouldn’t it stand to reason to continue to check the scribes and translators in the “New Testament”?

Section 4: Chap 3

The online “Wikipedia” states: in theism God is sometimes called Theos. The online Etymology Dictionary says that theo
is a word-forming element meaning "god, gods, God," of Greek theos "god.” God is used in the New Testament that is
translated from the Greek word “Theos”, typically for the Hebrew word “Ålahým”

Theos (θεός) Greek for “God” is the G2316 and occurs 1,343 times
The KJV translates “Strong’s” G2316 in the following manner: God (1,320x), god (13x), godly (3x), God-
ward (with G4214) (2x), misc (5x).

Kurios (κύριος) is a Greek word translating to "lord, master"; the Biblical Hebrew title "my lord" given to ‫יהוה‬.
Kurios (κύριος) Greek for "Lord" is the G2962 and occurs 748 times
The KJV translates “Strong’s” G2962 in the following manner: Lord (667x), lord (54x), master (11x), sir (6x), Sir (6x),
misc (4x).
            Whenever the OT (Old Testament) is quoted, the Greek “Kurios” for Lord is used in place of Yahūah/‫יהוה‬.

There are many scholars who contend with one another’s research regarding the authenticity of The Name ‫ יהוה‬in Greek NT
manuscripts; whether preserved in Paleo, found in Greek writings, or in the Hebrew/Aramaic script. One researcher will put out a
journal of a persuasive argument showing a clear indication that The Name in question, was replaced with surrogates from Greek NT
manuscripts. Then, immediately following his research, one of his peers will publish a research paper stating that The Name ‫יהוה‬
wasn’t replaced in the Greek manuscripts. Because it was not there at all after the second century. So any NT Greek manuscript, with
The Name ‫יהוה‬, after that time period lacks authenticity, because it would prove to be a copy of the original. Which then, leaves for
strong speculation that The Name could have been written in by the scribes, and not the original writers of the text.

In all my research on this one subject alone, I have found that every scholar’s journal, research paper, and online forum blog I have
personally read myself: from pastors, to teachers and laypersons, can all agree; that there is no conclusive evidence that the original
writers of the NT (New Testament) used surrogates (substitutes) to replace The Name ‫יהוה‬. It can also be agreed on, that Kyrios is
written in by the scribes as a substitute for This Name, ‫יהוה‬. This is a fact. No one argues this point which is the soul purpose of this
book. It makes no difference whether NT Greek manuscripts are copies or not. It makes no difference if there is any authentic
documentation left in the earth at all that proves The Name ‫ יהוה‬can be seen in a Greek NT manuscript in Paleo, or in the Hebrew
script, or what specific century the authenticity of the text ceased to be an original. I say this for one reason- The Written Word, NT
writers quoting OT passages, with The Name ‫ יהוה‬found in the quoted text. That alone is the strongest evidence anyone can produce in
proving The Name, ‫יהוה‬, to be as authentic, in a corrected translation, as the original Greek manuscript itself. If the writers are
quoting His Name, then there is no need for a surrogate argument, nor is there a need for the original document. A copy will do just
fine, thank you.
                                               It is evident that The Name of Yahūah has been removed or replaced in the English translation of
                                               the Old Testament. Evidence also shows The Name has been removed and or changed/corrupted
                                               in the New Testament as well. While considering the research of scholar George Howard, can
                                               God/theos or Lord/kurios replace the 4 letter Name of Yahūah/‫ יהוה‬spoken of by The Creator,
                                               without transgression, according to the written commandment found in the Hebrew text:
                                               Shamūṭh/Exod 20:7 - “You shall not lift up (speak) ‫ את‬The Name of ‫ יהוה‬your Ålahým to
                                               ruin it, for ‫ את יהוה‬will not acquit (pardon) anyone who lifts up (speaks) ‫ את‬His Name to
                                               ruin it.

                                                   I can see clearly now…

                                      Yahūshâ/‫ יהושע‬is a five (5) letter name
                                       Yahūah/‫ יהוה‬is a four (4) letter name
                                         B`âl/‫ בעל‬is a three (3) letter name
                                           God/‫ גד‬is a two (2) letter name
                                          Theos/θεός is cognate with God
                     Kurios/κύριος is where LORD is derived; LORD is cognate with B`âl/‫בעל‬
   Notice how B`âl, God, Theos, and Kurios are all family in origin? Yahūah and Yahūshâ stick out, all by themselves.

Section 4: Chap 4
                                                                    “as it is written”
  This section investigates the title Ålahým, The Name of Yahūah and The Name of Yahūshâ, in the New Testament. The
  quotes that read, “as it is written”, are notorious for changing The Name in the quote originating from OT passages.
                                          Let’s see what evidence can be found here.

                 Whenever OT passages are quoted with ‫אלהים‬, ‫יהוה‬, or ‫ יהושע‬the translator uses:


Kurios (κύριος) --- “LORD” for ‫יהוה‬/Yahūah
Iesoūs (Ἰησοῦς) --- “Jesus” for ‫יהושע‬/Yahūshâ
Theos (θεός) -------- “God” for ‫אלהים‬/Ålahým


                                             Observe:
      MaṭhaṭhYahū/Matt 4:7 *Yahūshâ quotes Dabarým/Deut 6:16. The name found there is, "                 ‫יהוה‬
       *‫( אלהיכם‬Yahūah your Ålahým a conjugated form)."         Let’s pull the English translation back, and see what’s
       under there…



                               From English standard version- MaṭhaṭhYahū/Matt 4:7
       *Yahūshâ/Jesus said to him, “Again it is written, ‘You shall not put the Lord your God to the test.’”


                                  Quote originates from: Dabarým/Deut 6:16
             Deut 6:16 “Do not test Yahūah/‫ יהוה‬your Ålahým/‫ אלהים‬as you tried Him in Masah.



                                      Greek rendering of Yahūah and Ålahým:
                                               κυριον τον θεον σου

                               ‫יהוה‬H3068 = kurios (κύριος) Greek for "Lord." G2962
                                ‫אלהים‬H430 = Theos (θεός) Greek for “God” G2316

 The information in the previous passages I hope, will encourage you to continue; to seek out The Name of Yahūah, ‘to see if these
 thing are so’; proving the foretelling of The Name of The Mashýacḥ. The remaining portion of this section consists of a list of NT
 quotes originating from the OT in a three column chart. Please note that I have not collected every passage on this subject. As you
study the scriptures, or read through the accounts of Yahūshâ at your leisure, common errors will become more and more obvious to
  you. The first column to the left are passages found in the NT, that quote or refer to a name in the OT. The middle column is the
Hebrew text the quote originates from in the OT passage. The last and third column at the right, is the quote in the English translation
            from the OT, that the NT writer is quoting. Compare the columns from left to right as directed by the arrows.

According to Yahūʿål/Joel 2:32, The Name to call on for Salvation, is Yahūah/‫יהוה‬. Yahūshâ said, “So also you have
sorrow now, but I will see you again, and your hearts will rejoice, and no one will take your joy away from you. 23At that time you
will ask me nothing. I tell you the solemn truth, whatever you ask the Father in My Name He will give you. 24Until now you have not
asked for anything in My Name. Ask and you will receive it, so that your joy may be complete. 25I have told you these things in
obscure figures of speech; a time is coming when I will no longer speak to you in obscure figures, but will tell you plainly about the
Father. 26At that time you will ask in My Name, and I do not say that I will ask the Father on your behalf. Yahūcḥanan 16: 22-26

                                                             He also said,
Believe me that I am in The Father, and The Father is in Me, but if you do not believe me, believe because of the miraculous deeds
themselves. 12I tell you the solemn truth, the person who believes in Me will perform the miraculous deeds that I am doing, and will
perform greater deeds than these, because I am going to The Father. 13And I will do whatever you ask in My Name, so that The
Father may be Esteemed in The Son. 14If you ask anything in My Name, I will do it. Yahūcḥanan 14: 11-14

We make our requests known to The Father, in The Name of Yahūshâ. When we call on The Name of Yahūah, He
always sends us Yahūshâ. Yahūshâ does the work! Yahūshâ is The Word/Law/Ṭūrah/Right-Rulings spoken from the
mouth of The Father. The only way we can be a friend of Yahūshâ, is to turn our hearts toward these commands that
came out of the mouth of His Father, Yahūah. This is why Yahūshâ said, “You are My Friends if you do what I command
you.” Yahūcḥanan 15:14

This is how to be friends with Ṭūrah, and all the Right-Rulings. If we turn a deaf ear to the Ṭūrah/Commands, our prayers
will be an abomination to Yahūah; even if we do ask Him for something in The Name of Yahūshâ.

The one who turns away his ear from hearing the law, even his prayer is an abomination. Mashalý 28:9 (Mashalý15:8, 29, 21:27;
Tahalým 66:18; YashâYahū 59:2; Yahūcḥanan 9:31; James 4:3)

         SECTION 4: Chap 5


                                       Evidence for the Name ‫יהוה‬



The following is a list of the witnesses (Acts 10:43, Dabarým/Deut 19:15, MaṭhaṭhYahū/Matt 18:16, Yahūcḥanan/Jn 8: 17-18) who testify to
The Name of Yahūah The Father (‫ )יהוה‬and His Son Yahūshâ (‫)יהושע‬. The Name of The Son testifies of The Name of The Father.
Who considers this? The names of these witnesses contain a portion of The Father’s Name, that aids us in pronouncing the first 3
letters of His Name (Shamūṭh/Ex 3:15) when read in the Hebrew text. These Hebrew names have been misspelled through a poor
Yiddish transliteration. As a result, our Creators Name, and the pronunciation, has been concealed when looking at the Yiddish forms
of these names. With this evidence exposed we can see beyond all reasonable doubt; what has been hidden from us for centuries.
Truth about The Name now, has become so obvious, so redundantly clear, that the only thing preventing us from knowing The Fathers
Name, and The Name of His Son, with the correct pronunciation; will be our own arrogance and rebellion.

Page Navigation:

The Top left of the page will list the corrected form of the Hebrew name in English. Next to its right side will be the same name in the
Hebrew/Aramaic script. To the far right, will be the same name in its incorrect form, as we have been taught to view it: the ruined
form – Yiddish. Each of these names who testify reveals the hidden “Yah” and “Yahoo” portions of The Father’s Name which better
aid us in transliteration and pronunciation. These “portions” will be underlined. Example: ‫עשיה – אדניהו‬

Underneath the name, will be its Hebrew reference number, where you can easily see its definition. This will include the ref# of
H3050. Notice that this particular number H3050 (from H3068), carries the eternal characteristic of the Father, and shows up in every
one of these names. The Exception: when the root is not listed, yet the Yahu is clearly visible in the name such as: Yahūdah, Yahūdý
and Yahūdýṭh. There will be other reference numbers in its definition. Studying these roots, is an important part of searching out The
Name.

While Looking up these “Strong’s” reference numbers, I want to bring to your attention the changes I have made in the listed
definitions. The “Strong’s” will frequently replace the Y in “Yah” with the letter J; even though it is apparent in the first
pronunciation, to the far right of the number, that the letter J and the J sound is misleading. I corrected this error, along with any
“Jahovah” transliterations, which referenced The Name of The Father. The blue box, found in the top right hand corner of each page,
will have “jah” replaced with “Yah”. The remaining J’s are left intentionally for observation. A review of the “Hebrew Ålaph Býṭh”
page of this book (p. 10) is recommended to better understand the individual sounds the Hebrew letters carry.

The blue box also emphasizes the H3050 for obvious reasons: it is a portion of the full name from this reference number H3068
meaning, Self-Existence (to exist; primary characteristic of Yahūah). The H3068 has the H1961 assigned to it. It is suggested in this
book, that this is incorrect. The root should be H1933. The address location of the name on the left, will have the corrected name of
the book where the name is found in scripture. The incorrect name of the book will be found on the far right. Below that, will be the
“Hebrew” text (the source we get our English translation from) with the witnesses’ names in blue, for easy viewing. The Fathers
Name will always be in the color red. The English translation will be below the Hebrew text, with the corresponding colors for each
name referenced. I have included a transliteration of the name on each page. If you notice names in the English translation which you
have never seen before, it’s because all the Hebrew names in the text have been restored to their correct pronunciation/spellings.
Yiddish or incorrect transliteration of names will be seen with a line through them. To review transliteration of a name, revisit page 34
of this book.

ÅcḥazYahū, and stole him from among the king’s sons that were slain, and put him and ‫– את‬
his nurse in a bedchamber. So Jehoshabeath (Yahūshabʿâth), the daughter of king Yahūram,
    the wife of YahūYadâ the kahan, (for she was the sister of ÅcḥazYahū,) hid him from
                           ÂṭhalYahū, so that she slew him not.

SECTION 4: Chap 6



                      Yahuah Yasha! Since the Days of Old
Several years back, I took the liberty to personally transcribe a video I watched online. That transcription turned out to be
about 17 pages long. After almost completing this book, I re-visited the 17 page long document. It’s one of my most favorite
documents on The Name of Yahūshâ I have ever had the privilege of owning. I thought to myself that inserting a few pages
of that information would be a great addition to the book. But it just wasn’t going to compare with how much better the
entire document is. I then decided it was no contest. The finishing cap on this book was going to have to be the transcribed
video of Yahūah Yashâ! Since the days of old. Enjoy!

There are a lot of inconsistencies from many teachers when it comes to the (shūâ) and (shâ) complex. I have written
several articles on it and broken down the many different false names of the Mashýacḥ such as yeshūâ, yahoshūâ,
yahūshūâ and many others. Awhile back in my studies, I came across something very interesting in the Ṭūrah/‫תורה‬. I
discovered that Yahūah’s Name was preceded by or was followed by the SHÂ root. I began to notice that there is a
saying in the Ṭūrah/‫ תורה‬about Yahūah SHÂ. Now, I had never seen that before because I had never done my studies
extensively from Hebrew. So, that’s what I want to share with you: YAHŪAH YASHÂ! Since the Days of Old.

With a little research you will find the root (Hebrew reference number) H3467 of Yashâ/‫ ישע‬is found in so many other
words attached to Yahūah/‫ יהוה‬all thru the Ṭūrah/‫תורה‬. I had someone tell me they were a bit concerned that I used
the Strong’s Concordance. When I give you Strong’s numbers, I’m giving these as reference numbers. When you begin to
go through study tools such as the Thayer’s, the TDNT and the Brown Driver Briggs, they do have that Strong’s number
attached to the word you want to look up. So they are referenced by that. I’m not giving you H3467 to go to the back of
your Concordance. You would never find out the full meaning. The Strong’s numbers are to aid you in a detailed
research of the etymological study of the word back to its root meaning. Again, I’m not telling you to go to the back of
your Concordance to find the true etymological meaning of the word in question. You must understand how to use
those reference numbers.

So, the ref# for YASHÂ/‫ ישע‬is the H3467 and means: deliver, help, salvation, victory. We are going to see how the
conjugated form of this word is found all through the Ṭūrah/‫ תורה‬and all about Yahūah/‫ יהוה‬directly giving salvation.

The Ṭūrah/‫ תורה‬reveals so many beautiful accolades about Yahūshâ/‫יהושע‬. He is the lion and the lamb, the High
Kahan, a warrior, friend, brother and deliverer. But most importantly, He is Yahūah Yashâ! This is one of the many
beauties of the Name that pull believers away from the use of Yahūah Shūâ. And that’s what this is all about. For those
of you who still think The Saviors Name is Yashūâ or Yahushūâ, we will take an in-depth look at YAHŪAH YASHÂ.

When we take The Name of Yahūah/‫יהוה‬, Ref# H3068, and the shortened form of that which is the H3050, Ya/‫יה‬, and
add that to the H3467 which is YASHÂ/‫ ישע‬, we get: Yahūah/‫ יהוה‬+ Yashâ/‫ =ישע‬YAHŪSHÂ/‫יהושע‬. The ref# affiliated
with The Name YAHŪSHÂ is the H3091. So, problems enter into the equation when people get confused about vowel
points: The Kabuts. When The Name of Yahūshâ was introduced in the Ṭūrah/‫תורה‬, there were no vowel points. It was
written as Yahūshâ/‫ יהושע‬and not as Yahūshūâ/‫יהושוע‬. Now, for the Nabýå Isaiah, his true name in Hebrew is
YashâYahū/‫יהשעיהו‬. Some versions display this name as YeshâYahū. Here is the basic root for Isaiah:

                            H3467=‫ ישע‬- YASHÂ (y-shâ) meaning deliver, help, salvation, victory
                               H3050=‫ – יה‬YA – a shortened form of H3068=‫ יהוה‬- YAHŪAH
                                         Same exact basic roots for The Saviors Name!

H3470 is the ref# for the name YashâYahū. INTERESTING! No one defending the name Yahūshūâ or Yeshūâ or Yehoshūâ
ever calls YashâYahū YESHŪÂYAHŪ! No one ever says that. Why? Because they understand that H3467, the yad/‫י‬,
shan/‫ש‬, and âýn/‫)ישע( ע‬, gives us -YASHÂ - opposed to YaSHŪÂ. So when you take a look at that H3467 plus H3050, it
gives us YashâYahū and not YashūâYahū.

Another Hebrew name to examine is Hosea/Hoshajah. That’s the canonized/Yiddish way of saying his name. But his real
name was HŪSHÂYAH. He had the exact same spelling of The Mashýacḥ's Name with the exception of the YA/‫ יה‬that
was at the end of the ŪSHÂ/‫ ושע‬root. {HŪSHÂ-YAH/Hosea} {YAHŪSHÂ/Savior} This ref# H1954 HŪSHÂ/‫ הושע‬which
means deliverance, plus YA/‫ יה‬which is the H3050= HŪSHÂYAH/‫הושעיה‬, also goes back to the H3467 YASHÂ/‫ישע‬. No
one ever calls this man HŪ-SHŪÂ-YAH. Because they would know his name is HŪshâYah. (The root H3467 YASHÂ/‫ישע‬
supports the SHÂ spelling not the SHŪÂ spelling.)

When we look at Joshua's original name, he had the same name as the Nabýå Hosea. HŪSHÂ. No one ever says that
Joshua's original name was HŪ-SHŪÂ. Because most people understand that his name was Hūshâ. So, as I move into
this, you will see that what we read in the English and what is said in the Hebrew, is actually a revelation of The Name of
The Mashýacḥ before the fortelling of His Name in ZakarYah/Zech chapter 6.

B-mdbar/Num 10:9 “And when you go into battle in your land against the enemy that distresses you, then you shall shout with the

trumpets, and you shall be remembered before ‫ יהוה‬your Ålahým/‫ אלהים‬and you shall be saved from your enemies.

Saved: There's that SHÂ/‫ שע‬root.

                                                           ‫נושעתים‬
                                                          nūshâṭhým
                                                       ~you shall be saved~

                                                            YASHÂ


The word NŪSHÂ/‫ נושע‬is derived from the H3467. It's in the plural form as in 'all of you.' When we say "our" or Âmanū,
(taken from the study of Emmanuel: see website video "Who is Emmanuel" (www.yahuahislife.com) it has a meaning of
"us" ÂMANŪ/‫עמנו‬. It’s the same thing here with the NŪSHÂ/‫נושע‬. The H3467 is the word for saved here. You shall be
YASHÂ! You shall be SHÂ! You shall be saved! You shall be delivered. What I want to do right now is give you a few cases
where the SHÂ root is used without the Hebrew letter yad/‫ י‬attached to it. It's not YASHÂ/‫ ישע‬here, it's actually
NŪSHÂ/‫ נושע‬saying, "All of you will be delivered."
                                                  (B-mdbar/Num 10:9 Hebrew text)

Let's take a look now at Ṭahalým/Psalms 50:23 to build a foundation before we get into the meat of the matter because
I think it's going to WOW all of you. It wow'd me!


Ṭahalým/Ps 50:23 “Whoever     offers praise esteems Me; And to him who prepares a way, I show the deliverance of Ålahým/‫אלהים‬.”
I show by "YASHÂ/‫ ישע‬Ålahým!" THE deliverance. We know to say THE using HA/‫ ה‬or Ba/‫ ב‬in the Hebrew. So, this
verse is actually saying, "Whoever offers praise to me, and to him who prepares a way, I show:

                                                             ‫בישע אלהים‬
                                                             ba-yashâ Ålahým
                                                       ~the deliverance of Ålahým~
                                                              yashâ -   ‫ישע‬
                                                                 H3467
                                                                 Yashâ

I show the deliverance of Ålahým: this is not SHŪÂ, like we are crying out to be saved, this is actual deliverance. This is
personal deliverance by YASHÂ/‫ ישע‬Âlahým/‫אלהעם‬. So He's saying, whoever prepares the way and esteems Him, he
show's YASHÂ/‫ ישע‬of Ålahým; He shows deliverance. Who is our deliverer? YA-HŪSHÂ. Yahūshâ!

If you esteem Yahūah, and if you prepare the way, He will show you YASHÂ. The YASHÂ of Ålahým. We know that the
Deliverance of The Mighty One is YAHŪSHÂ. That’s what this scripture is pointing to: The Mashýacḥ!

We will look at one more in YashâYahū/‫( ישעיהו‬Isaiah) before we get into the meat of the topic: YashâYahū/Isaiah 45:8


Just think: no one says YASHŪÂYAHŪ. If the word YASHÂ/‫ ישע‬is the yad/‫ י‬- shan/‫ ש‬- âýn/‫ע‬, and is the same word that
is attached to YAHŪSHÂ'S/‫ יהושע‬Name, how do we call him YAHŪSHŪÂ and NOT call YashâYahū YASHŪÂYAHŪ?
Hebrew is very, very consistent. What happens when you remove vowel points without any understanding of how to
read the Hebrew text as it is written? You become inconsistent!

I remember when I was in Israel among the congregation there, (they were proclaimers of the "weh" suffix affixed to
Yah's Name) they said, "You have to use vowel points". But the actual vowel points would have changed His Name to
"hovah" and not "wey". So then they say, "Well, the vowel points are not accurate on this particular word." I think it's
amazing that the people that use vowel points have even gone further to say, "Well, the vowel points were written
wrong on THIS word. They should have been written like this…"

The Masoretes knew what they were doing when they wrote the vowel points. They were writing in deception. So, what
you're saying is, THAT form of deception is wrong- but this is the correct form of deception. C'mon.
                                                                                                                  Page 338 of 396

Let's look at YashâYahū/Isa 45:8. We are talking about Yahūah Yashâ. I'm giving you words for YASHÂ/‫ ישע‬right now:
deliverance; savior; avenger; salvation, all these things found in that word. But when you look up SHŪÂ/‫ שוע‬which is
the Strong's #H7769, you will find it means the opposite: to scream, cry, cry out, halloo, or to wail. I will explain this
word further a little later when we look at "What is SHŪÂ?"

So, let's look now at YashâYahū/Isa 45:8 –

Isa 45:8 “Rain down, O heavens, from above, and let clouds pour down Righteousness. Let the earth open, let them bring forth
deliverance, and let Righteousness spring up together. I, ‫יהוה‬, have created it.

Åny/‫ אני‬Yahūah/‫ – יהוה‬I, Yahūah, have created it. Let them bring forth salvation! You know what the word here is for
salvation? YASHÂ/‫ישע‬: The H3467. We know that Isaiah's name means 'Yahū is salvation' or 'Salvation of Yah'. We
know that’s what Isaiah's name means. His name is Yashâ-Yahū and carries the same basic roots for The Son's Name.
YAHŪSHÂ! Yah of salvation, salvation of Yah, Yah is salvation or "Oh, Yah saves!" It depends on how you are breaking
down the etymology. It's all associated with SHÂ/‫שע‬.

Now, the part I'm excited about to get into, is the actual Hebrew where we get to see Yahūah's Name with the åūt/‫את‬,
(the first and the last), knowing this is talking about Yahūshâ with the YSHÂ/‫ ישע‬attached to it! You will find this so
many times in the Hebrew script, I couldn’t even write down all the times I found it. But I did take a few notes hoping
you will get just as excited about this as I am. Even more proof that the Father sent Yahūshâ for us: so much so, that
since the days of old, you can find BOTH of these names (Yahūah/‫ יהוה‬and Yahūshâ/‫ )יהושע‬in Ṭūrah/‫תורה‬, together;
giving us a very powerful message.

By the end of this lesson, if you're not smiling, there's something wrong with you. If you are not smiling with even more
proof after the Shūâ vs. Shâ 1, Shūâ vs. Shâ 2, and all the videos about The Name of The Savior; even more proof of The
Name of YAHŪSHÂ. Like, this is something to rejoice about. They are blaspheming The Name of Yahūshâ alright?!! You
have people on YouTube saying, "There is no Son of Yahūah. And then you have others saying, "We only lift up the one
true name of Yahūshūâ!" C'mon, man! Once we get thru these scriptures, you should be rejoicing because Yahūah/‫יהוה‬
just keeps on giving more and more evidence of The Name of The Savior!

Shamūʿål Býṭh/2Sam 8:6 ThenDūd/‫( דוד‬pronounced 'dood') put watch-posts in Åram/‫ ארם‬of Damashaq/‫דמשק‬. And the Åramý/‫ארמי‬
became Dūd/‫ דוד‬servants, and brought gifts. And ‫ יהוה‬saved Dūd/‫ דוד‬wherever he went.
Right here!   - And Yahūah saved ‫ את‬Dūd-

                                                        ‫וישע יהוה את דוד‬
                                                    ū-yshâ yahūah Åṭh Dūd
                                           ~and Yahuah Åṭh/‫( את‬Yahūshâ) saved Dud~
                                                             yashâ -   ‫ישע‬
                                                                H3467
                                                                Yashâ


Ū- yashâ= H3467 – Yahūah ‫ את‬Dūd. And Yahūah-‫ = את‬The First and The Last gave YASHÂ/‫ ישע‬H3467, salvation,
deliverance, to Dūd. So, Yahūah Yashâ! The English says Yahūah saved Dūd wherever he went. But the Hebrew says,
Yahūah, The First and The Last saved Dūd. The First and The Last is referring to The Savior. (YashâYahū/Isa 44:6, 48:12,
Cḥazūn/Rev1:11, 17, 2:8, 22:13) Ū Yashâ Yahūah Åṭh - Dūd. Yahūah Yashâ! I know that for some people who are new to the
Hebrew, this lesson is not going to make much sense to you. But that’s ok. Look over these study notes and you will
                                                                                                                 Page 339 of 396

begin to see a powerful message right here in the Hebrew text waiting to be seen. We are seeing The Name of The Son
that cannot be refuted. It cannot be disputed. That’s how rich it is in the text.


Mashlý/Prov 20:22   Do not say, “I repay evil.” Wait for ‫יהוה‬, and He saves you.
Here it is again! Yahūah saves:
                                                     and he saves Yahūah   wait on

                                                          ‫קוה ליהוה וישע‬
                                                     qūah la-Yahūah ū-yashâ
                                                 ~wait on Yahūah, and he saves ~
                                                              yashâ - ‫ישע‬
                                                                 H3467
                                                                 yashâ

-And Yahūah-He-saves. See that? Yahūah Yashâ. The H3068 plus the H3467. Once again, when we look at YASHÂ/‫ישע‬,
we already know that nobody calls the H3467 YASHŪÂ/‫ישוע‬. Everyone calls the H3467 YASHÂ/‫ישע‬. That’s why they say
YashâYahū. And some will say, "Well yeah, deliverance means Yashâ but, without the vowels see, there are two different
forms of YASHÂ…" No, there's not. You have the H3467 and the H3468 which is a derivative of H3467. The scripture
says:

                                                             ‫יהוה ישע‬
                                                        YAHUAH YASHA!!!
                                                      …since the days of old…

Since the days of old he has been saying, Yahūah Yashâ. Not Yahūah Shūa. What I'm doing is I'm reading the English,
then, I'm reading it in the Hebrew. So you can see that all the times where Yahūah Yashâ is, the message is 'Yahūah
Saves'. How do you get The Saviors Name? You take Yahūah/‫ יהוה‬plus Yashâ ‫ישע‬.

                                                      H3068 + H3067 = H3091
                                                       ‫ יהוה‬+ ‫יהושע = ישע‬
                                                     Yahūah + Yashâ = Yahūsha

Dabarým/Deut 33:29 “Blessed  are you, O Yasharʿål/‫ !ישראל‬Who is like you, a people saved by ‫יהוה‬, the shield of your help, and He
who is the sword of your excellency! And your enemies are subdued for you, and you tread down their high places.”


Remember, we did the lesson on Emmanuel. The Hebrew showed it was actually "âmanūʿål" meaning: amongst us.
Do you know what this scripture is saying when it says, "Baruk are you, O Yasharʿål – a people saved by Yahūah?
It actually says:

                                                          ‫עם נושע ביהוה‬
                                                         âm nūshâ b-Yahūah
                                                        ~tribe saved by Yahūah~
                                                             nūshâ -   ‫נושע‬
                                                                 H3467
                                                                 Yashâ
                                                                                                                Page 340 of 396

It combines the âmanū for (amongst us), with the SHÂ. Here you have shâ without the yad/‫י‬. It goes back to H3467.

SHÂ is the actual root of YASHÂ. Yashâ is just saying "He saves." So, when it says a people saved by Yahūah, it says, “âma
nūshâ b- Yahūah”: a people saved; a people delivered; a people having salvation by Yahūah. YAHŪAH NŪSHÂ on this one
opposed to Yahūah SHÂ - The NŪSHA is a derivative of H3467 - YASHÂ. I think this one is beautiful! If you understand
âmanūʿål, then you can really appreciate âmanū shâ! Because its showing that salvation is amongst us. Salvation is in our
presence; in our midst. His Name shall be mighty amongst us – Âmanūʿål. You are a people who has the salvation of
Yahūah amongst you. You are saved by Yahūah. Âmanū shâ b- Yahūah. A very beautiful thing here. I know that some are
not understanding this, but some of you do! So you should be smiling from ear to ear. We should get chapped lips from
smiling too much thinking about the beauty of His Name and how in the Ṭūrah/‫ תורה‬it is shown to us over and over
again.

Remember now, this word nūshâ: the nun/‫ נ‬and the aua/‫ ו‬is added for (nū). For people: to represent a people; in plural
form. Then combined with SHÂ, NŪ-SHÂ/ ‫נושע‬: This is saying, "people saved." Âmanūshâ…Âmanū shâ b- Yahūah: a
people saved by Yahūah. "Yahūah SHÂ since the days of old." That SHÂ root has been affixed to His Name ever since the
beginning! Because it was already being prophesied what was going to happen. We were going to have Yahūah SHÂ, the
family Name; Yahūah ʿåth, The First and The Last in the flesh! Representing The Name of His Father like He said, and
bringing forth what we seen in Ṭūrah/‫ תורח‬about who He was: Salvation. From the root word YASHÂ/‫ – ישע‬the H3467.
Remember I told you the NŪSHÂ: ‫ע‬-‫ש‬-‫ו‬-‫ נ‬is the plural way of saying 'people saved'. If I say, that tribe shall be saved, I
would say NŪSHÂ. Âm-nūshâ combined is âmanūshâ.



                             ‫ ישראל‬shall be saved by ‫ יהוה‬with an everlasting deliverance. You are not to be ashamed nor hurt,
YashâYahū/Isa 45:17 Yasharʿål/
forever and ever.
                                                by Yahūah   shall be saved   Yasharʿål

                                                     ‫ישראל נושע ביהוה‬
                                                Yasharʿål nūshâ b-Yahūah
                                           ~Yasharʿål shall be saved by Yahūah ~
                                                         nūshâ - ‫נושע‬
                                                      derives from H3467
                                                             yashâ

There's that Yahūah SHÂ again. Yasharʿål shall be saved by Yahūah. What's the word for salvation here? NŪSHÂ. It comes
from the SHÂ/‫ ישע‬root: H3467. What's the root of The Saviors Name Yahūshâ? H3467. What's The Father's Name?
Yahūah: H3068. So, here you have again from the days of old, Yahūah and YASHÂ: the salvation; deliverance; the
avenger; of Yahūah. That’s beautiful. Nūshâ b- Yahūah.

I was a little nervous giving this lesson wondering if anyone was going to understand what I'm talking about because
many are not familiar with the Hebrew text. But, if you have been coming into the knowledge of The Name of Yahūshâ,
one of the first names you came across was Yahūshūa. Simply because we don’t understand about the SHÂ and SHŪÂ
root. So, this is just more proof on that. Refer back to the website www.yahuahislife.com and look at the SHŪÂ vs SHÂ
articles. I did two full length articles about this subject and I took all the SHŪÂ names and broke them down in Hebrew
to reveal how they could not be Yahūshūa.
                                                                                                                  Page 341 of 396

Shamūṭh/Ex 14:30 Therefore,   ‫ יהוה‬saved Yasharʿål/‫ ישראל‬that day out of the hand of the Matsarý, and Yasharʿål/‫ ישראל‬saw the
Matsarý/‫ מצרי‬dead on the seashore.
See that? Yahūah saved. Do you know how to say Yahūah saved in Hebrew? You say, Yahūah YASHÂ! Do you know how to say, and
therefore, Yahūah saved? You say, "Ū y-ūshâ Yahūah. You will find the U/‫ ו‬in front of the SHÂ:


                                                            ‫ויושע יהוה‬
                                                        ū y-ūshâ Yahūah
                                               ~and therefore, (he) Yahūah saved ~
                                                               shâ - ‫שע‬
                                                                H3467
                                                                 yashâ

                          Here in Shamūṭh/Exodus chapter 14, it says Yahūah saved. Yahūah SHÂ:

                                                  H3068 + H3067 = H3091
                                                    ‫ יהוה‬+ ‫יהושע = ישע‬
                                                 Yahūah + Yashâ = Yahūshâ
Here's my thing; If the same exact roots from The Saviors Name is Yahūah and YASHÂ, how on earth, do we blaspheme
Him and say He's a cry baby? How do we say He cries out? How do we take the word YAHŪ or Yahūah and attach
SHŪÂ/‫ שוע‬to the end of it? Why can't we see that it's not only a sin, its blasphemy! And then there are brothers and
sisters who know the true Name but still listen to people who defend The Name of Yahūshūâ. Would you call The Savior
Fred? If I began to refer to The Savior as Burtrude, would you listen to me anymore? Of course you wouldn't. Because
you would say, "Oh, that’s not His Name! That’s just wrong!" Yahūshūâ is just as wrong as Burtrude! So, if you wouldn't
listen to me for calling Him Burtrude, why are you listening to someone calling Him Yahūshūâ? It's blasphemy.
Shamūṭh/Exodus even shows Yahūah SHÂ! That’s power! Yahūah SHÂ! Yahūah YASHÂ since the days of old.

Shamūʿål Ålaph/I Sam 14:23 Therefore,   ‫ יהוה‬saved Yasharʿål/‫ ישראל‬that day, and the battle passed over to Býṭh Åūn.

Thus Yahūah saved Yasharʿål. You see, there it is! Thus Yahūah saved Yasharʿål. Now, when you read this it doesn’t say
SHŪÂ! To say, "Therefore Yahūah saved Yasharʿål," we would have this once again:

                                                            ‫ויושע יהוה‬
                                                        ū y-ūshâ Yahūah
                                               ~and therefore, (he) Yahūah saved ~
                                                               shâ - ‫שע‬
                                                                H3467
                                                                 yashâ

I think it's beautiful cause to say, 'Therefore He saved', you would have the UAU/‫( ו‬pronounced 'oo') and then you
would have what looks like 'yoo-sha' which is very close to hoo-sha. Ū Y-ŪSHÂ YAHŪAH! Then you read a little bit more
and it says Yasharʿål Åṭh-The First and the Last: The people of The First and The Last. Here again, 'Therefore, Yahūah
saved'. Therefore Yahūah SHÂ! From the ref# H3467 YASHÂ/‫ישע‬. Therefore Yahūah Ū YASHÂ! No SHŪÂ/‫ שוע‬here! I'm
                                                                                                               Page 342 of 396

saying again, he saved. How did he save? Through SHÂ/‫שע‬. YASHÂ/‫ישע‬. The H3467 which represents the strength of
His salvation. Yahūah Yashâ or Yahūah SHA. Let's move on now to Dabarý Ha Yamým Ålaph/IChr 18:6

Dabarý Ha Yamým Ålaph/IChr 18:6 And   Dūýd/‫ דויד‬stationed [men] in Åram/‫ ארם‬of Damashaq/‫דמשק‬, and the Åramý/‫ ארמי‬became
servants of Dūýd/‫דויד‬, and brought gifts. And ‫ יהוה‬saved ‫ את‬Dūýd/‫ דויד‬wherever he went.



                                                   ‫ויושע יהוה את דויד‬
                                                   u-yūshâ Yahūah Åṭh Dūýd
                                      ~and thus, (He) Yahūah Åṭh/‫( את‬Yahusha) saved Dūýd~
                                                           shâ -   ‫שע‬
                                                            H3467
                                                            Yashâ


We know what the word for salvation is: YASHÂ/‫ישע‬. We know what The Fathers Name is: Yahūah/‫יהוה‬. So that's
Yahūah-YASHÂ. Now, how do you say Yahūah saved David/Dūýd? This is the way we would say it: ū-yūshâ Yahūah Åṭh
Dūýd. Now, this scripture will say Dūýd/‫דויד‬, pronounced doo-eed, because the yad/‫ ו‬was added. The original way it
was written was ‫דוד‬, pronounced dood. So, you will see Dūýd on this one, but it says here: ū-yūshâ Yahūah Åṭh Dūýd!
There it is again: and Yahūah saved Dūýd. Yahūah YASHÂ!

You know, many people say that the SHŪÂ/‫ שוע‬means salvation. But as we are looking this up, we are seeing that when
Yahūah's Name is involved, we have NOT seen Yahūah SHŪÂ/‫ שוע‬Dūd. We are not seeing that. We are seeing: Yahūah
SHÂ or yaSHÂ or ūSHÂ or nūSHÂ. All of these are derivatives of H3467 YASHÂ/‫ישע‬: deliverance; salvation; deliverer;
avenger; YASHÂ. That’s who Yahūshâ is. We don’t apply SHŪÂ/‫ שוע‬to any of these. All we have to do is look into the
Hebrew; since the days of old. We have been getting a foretaste of His Name before it was ever spoken in the ear of
mankind; before it was ever spoken by man as a name, it was already evident for what he did for Dūd and the children
of Yasharʿål. This is so beautiful to me!

                                         ‫ יהוה‬saved ‫ את‬YacḥazaqYahū/‫ יחזקיהו‬and the inhabitants of Yarūshalam/‫ירושלם‬
Dabarý Ha Yamým Býṭh/IIChr 32:22 Therefore,
from the hand of Sanacḥarýb/‫ סנחריב‬the sovereign of Åshūr/‫אשור‬, and from the hand of all others, and guided them on every side.

                        When it says, therefore Yahūah saved YacḥazaqYahū, it says in the Hebrew:

                                               ‫יחזקיהו‬-‫ויושע יהוה את‬
                                           ū-yūshâ Yahūah Åṭh - YacḥazaqYahū
                        ~and therefore, (he) Yahūah Åṭh/ ‫( את‬Yahūshâ) saved YacḥazaqYahū ~
                                                           shâ - ‫שע‬
                                                            H3467
                                                            Yashâ
It's saying here that Yahūah gave the YaSHÂ! He gave deliverance; salvation; to YachazaqYahu. The ‫ את‬is the strength of
His deliverance. What is attached to his deliverance? The SHÂ root. Ū-yūshâ Yahūah Åṭh! It's amazing because it's
spelled y-u-s-h-a. The yad/‫ י‬is just saying (he). So, you would say 'he saved' like this: y-ūsha. It sounds very close to
Yahū-shâ. You will see a little bit later, we will look at the phrase: 'Yahūah is your salvation'. The way you would write
                                                                                                                    Page 343 of 396

'your salvation' in Hebrew is Mashý-acḥ. Writing certain phrases in Hebrew includes attaching particular characters to a
given word causing it to mean something new. (Conjugated forms of words) I find it amazing to see here that "Yahūah
saved" is Yahūah y-ūshâ. Sounding like Yahūah Yahūshâ. Yet it is said y- ŪSHÂ, without the Ha/‫ה‬. No one can look at the
Hebrew text and say this is SHŪÂ or means SHŪÂ. But people will take these same roots and put them together and call
those SHŪÂ. It's evident right here. This is all SHÂ. Because that’s what Yahūah gave us. He gave us deliverance through
His Son: our savior; our Mashýacḥ; YAHŪSHÂ.
Now, we are going to look at the Yahūshâ root with an extra yad/‫י‬

Shamūʿål Ålaph/I Sam 17:47 and all this assembly know that ‫ יהוה‬does not save with sword and spear, for the battle belongs to ‫יהוה‬,
and He shall give you into our hands.”
When he says here that he saves not, it actually says:

                                                            ‫יהושיע יהוה‬
                                                          y-hūshýâ Yahūah
                                                      ~ Yahūah saves/delivers ~
                                                             hūshýâ - ‫הושיע‬
                                                                 H3467
                                                                 Yashå

You have Yahūshâ/‫ יהושע‬with a yad/‫ י‬between the shan/‫ ש‬and the âýn/‫ע‬. YahūshYâ. We will find out later how this is
connected to the Hebrew phrase Hūshýʿâh nå (Hosanna). It's all going back to the same thing: that Yahūah saves. The
'saves not' of course is 'la Yahūah'. ('La' meaning 'no')The "Yahūah saves" in the phrase, 'Yahūah saves not by the
sword', is actually saying in the Hebrew: y-hūshyâ Yahūah – Yahūah saves - When you look this up in the interlinear, it
will give you the root H3467 YASHÂ/‫ישע‬. All these are different forms of the word YASHÂ. It means the power and the
strength of our salvation, not SHŪÂ.

Ṭahalým/Ps 118:25 I   pray, O ‫יהוה‬, please save; I pray, O ‫יהוה‬, please send prosperity.
Now, this is the word in the Hebrew you will see as: Hūshýʿâh nå – this is the word where the Greeks get Hosanna from:


                                                                G 5614
                                                                ὡσαννά
                                                               `osannah
                                                              (ho-san-nah)
                                                            save, we pray!
                                                         from H3467 & H4994


Hosanna means 'save us, we pray' or 'save me, I pray'. It will show you when you go to the G5614, it shows that Hosanna
comes from Hebrew. It shows you the Hebrew root of H3467 which is YASHÂ, and the H4994 NA/‫( נא‬I pray)yashâ-nå.
When its saying 'save us I pray', it's not saying Hosanna.
                                                                                                                    Page 344 of 396

From the original text, the Hebrew, its saying:

                                                        ‫יהוה הושיעה נא‬
                                                        Yahūah hūshýʿâh nå
                                                    ~ save us we pray Yahūah ~
                                                           hūshýâ - ‫הושיע‬
                                                               H3467
                                                               yashâ

                                The verse referring to the word Hosanna is MaṭhaṭhYahū/Matt 21:9, 15
So, the original way to say 'save us we pray' is hūshyʿâh nå. The Greeks say it as Hosanna. Here in Ṭahalým/Ps 118:25 when
it says 'I pray oh Yahūah please save', its saying, Yahūah hūshýʿâh nå! Please save, Yahūah! No one would say reading
this verse in the Hebrew, 'Yahūah hūshūâýʿâh nå. No one would say that. Because it is clear this is a SHÂ root.
All these SHÂ roots are affixed to Yahūah's Name in front or after them; showing that He is The Beginning and The End
of our salvation! Like, this is like really, really beautiful! Like, are you not smiling yet?
Lets move on- I got to get a smile out of you before this is over with.

Ṭahalým/Ps 3:7 Arise, O ‫ ;יהוה‬Save me, O my Ålahým/‫ !אלהים‬Because You have smitten all my enemies on the cheek; You have
broken the teeth of the wrong.

These verses are now all saying, ‘Hūshýʿâh nå’. All from the SHÂ root. Hūshýʿâh nå, Save us, I pray! Save us we pray!
When he says, Arise, O ‫ ;יהוה‬Save me, O my Ålahým/‫ !אלהים‬he is saying:


                                                          ‫יהוה הושיעני‬
                                                         Yahūah hūshýʿâný
                                                    ~ save me I pray Yahūah ~
                                                          hūshýâ - ‫הושיע‬
                                                              H3467
                                                              yashâ
                                                       Hūshýʿâný = save me
                                                       Hūshýʿâh nå = save us

'Arise Yahūah, save me!' is what this is saying and it comes from the SHÂ root. From the Hebrew: Yahūah hūshýʿâný.
Now, we know the only difference between hūshâ/‫ הושע‬and hushý/‫ הושי‬is the use of the yad/‫ י‬and the âýn/‫ע‬.
This is just so beautiful. All these different forms of the word YASHÂ, the H3467, are all attached to Yahūah's Name:
Yahūah Hūshýʿâný; Yahūah hūshýʿâh nå; Yahūah hūshâ; Yahūah shâ; Yahūah yashâ; because he is our salvation!
Ṭahalým/Ps 12:1 Save,   ‫יהוה‬, for the kind one is no more! For the trustworthy have ceased from among the sons of men.

                                                          ‫יהוה הושיעה‬
                                                          Yahūah hūshýʿâh
                                                       ~ save (me) Yahūah ~
                                                           hūshyâ - ‫הושיע‬
                                                               H3467
                                                               yashâ
                                                                                                                           Page 345 of 396

     All these scriptures are saying the same thing: hūshýʿâh nå, hūshýʿâný, hūshýʿâh nū; save us, save, save me. What's the
    word for salvation here? It’s the H3467 SHÂ. They are all attached to Yahūah's Name because Yahūah SHÂ. Yahūah
    saves: YAHŪAH YASHÂ = HE SAVES YAHŪSHÂ = salvation is of Yahūah; Yahūah is salvation; Yahūah is deliverer; Yahūah
    is avenger. When you say, Yahū-SHŪÂ, you are saying he cries. You're going to see when we look at SHŪÂ, that the
    scripture says 'My servant will not cry out'. That’s what the scripture says! Whenever you say he cries out, you call him a
    liar. Because it says that His servant will not cry out; the one coming for us will not cry out. So Yahūshâ could not have
    been Yahūshūâ because that would mean he cries out. Doesn’t mean wealth, riches or noble, it means 'he cries'. It’s a
    sin to even say that. So, let's move on.

    Ṭahalým/Ps 20:9 Save,   ‫ !יהוה‬Let the Sovereign answer us in the day we call.
    Same thing! Save, Yahūah! This is personal. Save, Yahūah. (The 'me' is implicated) Hūshýʿâh nå Yahūah! Same root again.

                                                               ‫יהוה הושיעה‬
                                                               Yahūah hūshýʿâh
                                                            ~ save (me) Yahūah ~
                                                                hūshyâ - ‫הושיע‬
                                                                    H3467
                                                                    yashâ

                                                       H3068 + H3067 = H3091
                                                         ‫ יהוה‬+ ‫יהושע = ישע‬
                                                      Yahūah + Yashâ = Yahūshâ

                                                                  ‫יהוה ישע‬
                                                            YAHUAH YASHA!!!
                                                           …since the days of old…

Since Shamūṭh/Exodus! And I want to tell you, I looked up every YASHÂ. I looked up every H3467 and every single H3468. I
read the etymology for every single form. I'm not doing guess work here. I looked all of this up. Look them up for yourself
and you will see that it's always Yahūah SHÂ, Yahūah NŪSHÂ, Yahūah ÂMANŪSHÂ, Yahuah HŪSHÝʿÂH NÅ, Yahūah
HŪSHÝʿÂNÝ; all from Yahūah and YASHÂ – the H3467. I started off showing you when you take the [H3068 Yahūah] and
combine it with the [H3067 YASHA], you get YAHŪSHÂ! Let's move on. We are looking at each conjugated form separately.

YashâYahū/ Isa 49:26 “And   I shall feed those who oppress you with their own flesh, and let them drink their own blood as sweet wine. All
flesh shall know that I, ‫יהוה‬, am your Saviour, and your Redeemer, the Ålahým/‫ אלהעם‬of Yʿâqb.”
I like this one…we know that Yahūshâ is our Mashýacḥ. Do you know how to say Yahūah is your Savior?


                                                          ‫כי אני יהוה מושיעך‬
                                                           ký åný Yahūah mūshýak
                                                    ~ for I am Yahūah: your salvation ~
                                                                mūshýâ - ‫מושיע‬
                                                                    H3467
                                                                    yashâ
                                                                                                                          Page 346 of 396

Mūshýak sounds like Mashýacḥ. In Hebrew to say 'your', you have to end a word with ‫ך‬. The word used here is mūshʿâh.




                                                                ‫מושעה‬
                                      mūshʿâh (moo-shah) H4190 comes from H3467 YASHÂ/‫ישע‬
                                                                deliverance



   If you want to say deliverance or savior you would say mūshâ. To say I am your savior you would say mūshýak.
   What do we know about Yahūshâ?

                                                  mūshýak (moo-shee-ahk) = your savior
                                                                H4190
                                                                   ‫מושיעך‬


                                                 mashýacḥ (ma-shee-acḥ) =anointed one

                                                                    H4899
                                                                    ‫משיח‬
   I think this is so beautiful because once you really start learning how to read and write Hebrew, you will see how words
   come together with characters being added to mirror the same sound of other words having the same meaning when
   they are in context. How much can you twist mūshýak? Read it for yourself. Mūshýak. I, Yahūah Am your Savior; your
   Deliverance; your Salvation; your Avenger; your Protection; The One that Covers you. Mūshýak sounds just like
   Mashýacḥ.

   That’s how you say 'your Savior' in Hebrew.




   YashâYahū/Isa 60:16 “And   you shall drink dry the milk of the gentiles, and shall milk the breast of sovereigns. And you shall know that
   I, ‫יהוה‬, am your Saviour and your Redeemer, the Ålahým/‫ אלהעם‬of Yʿâqb.




                                               When it says, 'I, Yahūah your Savior', it says:
                                                           ‫אני יהוה מושיעך‬
                                                            åný Yahūah mūshýak
                                                       ~ I am Yahūah: your savior ~
                                                               mūshýâ - ‫מושיע‬
                                                                   H3467
                                                                   yashâ
                                                                                                           Page 347 of 396

For I, Yahūah (self-existent; the eternal) mūshýʿâk. Åný Yahūah mashýacḥ. I, Yahūah, Am your Savior, your Salvation. This
is all related to this root H3467 which is YASHÂ/‫ישע‬. But if you look at the Hebrew 4190, the word mūshʿâh is used. It’s
from the use of this word mūshʿâh that we get mashýʿâk. So, when you take 'your' which is represented by the kaf/‫ך‬,
with mūshâh/4190 with YASHÂ/3467 you get mūshýʿâk. I said along time ago that Hebrew words break down into two
or three basic roots. Many Hebrew words are compound: YashâYahū; Yahūshâ; Yahūah…

Looking at the word Hūsha: you have [Hu] which is to say Oh! or Alas! Then you have [Shâ] Together they say Hūshâ.
This word here mūshýʿâk breaks down to the 4190 for mūshah , which comes from the 3467-YASHÂ; and to say 'your' in
Hebrew, add the kaf/‫ ך‬to the end and that makes it 'yours'. Notice: none of these contain any portion of the H7769
SHŪÂ. Otherwise he would be saying I am the one that cries. Someone said to me, ''Well, doesn't he cry out when we
sin?'' I don’t understand why we rationalize things. Does he cry when we sin? Yes, he's disappointed and he is also angry.
Do we rationalize putting anger or sad at the end of His Name? We have to call him what he said to call him. Zakaryah 6:
10-12, reading about the high Kahan (Yahūshâ). ZakarYah takes the crown of silver and gold and sets it on the head of
the high Kahan and he said, ''Behold! The man whose Name is The Branch!'' We did a study on The Branch. Yahūshâ
himself says, ''I Am The Branch''. He said He was the root, the offspring of Jesse found in Cḥazūn/Rev 22:16. We have to
call him by The Name His Father said His Name would be. This is just more proof that since the days of old, the
H3068/Yahūah has always been used in conjunction with the H3467/YASHÂ. Because…

                                                       ‫יהוה ישע‬
                                                  YAHUAH YASHA!!!
                                                  …since the days of old

B-mdbar/Num 13:8 From the tribe of Åpharým: Hūsha, son of Nūn.
I want to show you something about Joshua: (for all the SHUA observers) what's the original name of Joshua? They say
it's Hoshea. I'll say, ''Don't give me the Greek or the English/Yiddish counterpart. What was Joshua's original name in the
Hebrew before Mashah changed it?

They never comment on that. The only difference between the original name of Joshua and The Name of The Savior, is
the yad/‫י‬. The remaining letters in both names are identical in sequence. They are exactly the same! No one calls Joshua
'Hushua'. His name was 'Hūshâ' with the H1954 which means, 'deliverer'. Some may say his name was Hoseah. We
know that’s not Hebrew. There is no 'Ho' pronunciation in Hebrew. The 'Ho' does not exist. For the black Hebrew
Israelites preaching about the name Yehoshua: your saying, Yeho cries. I don’t know what 'Ye' means. If your taken the
'Ye' to be the yad/‫ י‬which represents the 'hand', then you're saying ''the hand of the ho that cries.'' Where does the 'Ho'
come from? There is no 'Ho' in Hebrew. In some versions Joshua's name is spelled 'Oshea son of Nūn'. These are all
Yiddish forms.

                                                          H1954
                                                    ‫הושע‬
                                               Husha (hoo-sha')
                                                       Deliverer

Hūshâ was his original name! The only difference between his name and The Savior was before Masha added the yad/‫י‬.
The name HūshâYah which is the H1955 we looked at earlier carries Hūshâ as well.
                                                                                                                 Page 348 of 396

Let’s look at verse 16 of the same chapter.

B-mdbar/Num 13:16 These are the names of the men whom Mashah sent to spy out the land. And Mashah called Hūshâ the son of
Nūn, Yahūshâ.

See this? Mashah changed his name. He began to call him by a different name. What does Hūshâ mean? Hūshâ means
deliverance. It comes from the root of SHÂ the H3467. When you put the yad/‫ י‬in front of Hūshâ, now you have Ya +
Hūshâ = Yahūshâ.
                                             How did Joshua's name: Hūshâ

                                                            ‫הושע‬
                                                       become yahūshūâ?

                                                          ‫יהושוע‬
                                              Wouldn’t HUSHA + YA = YAHUSHA?
                                             How does HUSHA + YA = YAHUSHUA?
                                                  By way of ignorance only.


Now, I'm going to show you The Fathers Name was adjacent to just Hūsha by itself.

When you look up Hūsha, it does show the Strong's H3467; but it also shows the H1954. You can actually find Yahūah's
Name in Hūsha! Because we know Hūsha means salvation:

YaramYahū/Jer 31:7 For thus said ‫יהוה‬, “Sing with gladness for Yʿâqb, and shout among the chief of the nations. Cry out, give
praise, and say, ‘O ‫יהוה‬, save Your people, the remnant of Yasharʿål!’
When it says, 'Yahūah save your people', it says:


                                                    ‫הושע יהוה את עמך‬
                                                  hūshâ Yahūah Åṭh ʿâmak
                                          ~Yahūah Åṭh (Yahūshâ), save your tribe ~
                                                         Hūshâ - ‫הושע‬
                                                       H1954 from H3467
                                                            Yashâ


Hūsha! Deliver; save, Yahūah: your people. âmak: âm - we translate this 'am' to 'people'. It technically means tribe.
H5971 ‫( עם‬âm)=people, a congregated unit; specifically: a tribe –    ‫=עמך‬your tribe. ‫=ך‬kaf
There's the conjugated form right there. The kaf makes it 'your tribe'. The ‫ את‬reveals the tribe of 'The First and The Last'.
So, here you have The Mark of The First and The Last, with a portion of The Name He would carry when He came to
earth! Hūshâ Yahūah Åṭh âmak – The First and The Last Yahūah-Hūshâ your people: save; bring salvation; deliver your
people. Is this beautiful? None of these scholars and SHŪÂ people will look at this and say Hūshūâ. Cause guess what?
The Masorites didn’t even vowel point this to say Hūshūâ. They vowel pointed it to say, Hosea. Even they are not calling
this SHŪÂ. Think about it. The Masorites invented the vowel points to change the language. They don’t even call Hūshâ
SHŪÂ. So, how do you explain calling Hūshâ 'Hūshūâ' when you put a yad/‫ י‬in front of it. Even the Jews weren’t that
                                                                                                           Page 349 of 396

deceptive when they did this ok? They were deceptive and caused a lot of people to go astray, and many may burn
because of this. But they don’t even do that SHŪÂ thing on this one here. They pronounce this as Hosea. But they send it
back to the H3467 YASHA. When you go to the H3467 there is only ONE way they pronounce it: YSHÂ. They do not put
SHŪÂ to it. So when you look at Hūshâ it goes back to YASHÂ. Where does the SHŪÂ come from? It comes from your
mind! That’s where it comes from. You're making it up. It does not exist.

That’s Hūshâ Yahūah! Now, let's go to Hūshâ/Hosea 1:7!
Hūshâ/Hosea 1:7 “But I shall have compassion on the house of Yahūdah/‫ יהודה‬and save them by ‫ יהוה‬their Ålahým/‫אלהים‬, and
not save them by bow or by sword or battle, by horses or horsemen.”

Hūshâ(Hosea) had the same name as Hūshâ (Joshua) in the beginning. Then Mashah changed his name to Yahūshâ
because we know that Joshua was a foreshadow of the Mashýacḥ to come. So much so, that even when everyone was
removed from the tent of meeting, when Yahūah was speaking to Mashah only, (Shamūṭh/Exodus 33:11) guess who
was in the back of the tent listening? The one who carried the same name of the coming Mashýacḥ! That’s right! Joshua
stayed in the tent. That Name remained in the tent. What did Yahūah tell the men who were with ZakarYah? He said.
''You men are men of symbol". We know that the high Kahan Yahūshâ carried The Name of The Mashýacḥ. So when
Yahūah is speaking through ZakarYah to these men in chapter 1: 1-3 of ZakarYah/Zech, he's telling them, 'you men are
men of symbol'. There something about you-you're going to symbolize something. We know that the high Kahaným
father's name was Yahūtsadaq which means Yahūah is Righteousness; we read about the fortelling of him being called,
'bn Yahūtsadaq' –Son of Righteousness. C'mon people! We can't put this together and figure out what His name is? We
can’t put this together and see that no one is twisting scriptures here?



                                                     ‫והושעתים ביהוה‬
                                                   ū- hūshaṭhým b-Yahūah
                                                 ~and save them by Yahūah ~
                                                         Hūshâ - ‫הושע‬
                                                       H1954 from H3467
                                                            yashâ

Two words here once again: Hūshâ-Yahūah

To save them is to say Hūshaṭhým. We know that the 'ym' is plural, so the thym provides the ‘them’. The two basic roots
again: Hūshâ-H1954 which goes back to the H3467, and you have Yahūah-H3068

                                                              ‫יהוה‬
                                                         Yahuah (ya-hoo-ah)
                                                    self-existent, the eternal

Yahūah Hūshâ. We have seen Yahūah SHÂ, Yahūah y-ūshâ, Yahūah hūshýʿâh nå, Yahūah hūshâ…all these words! The
Strong's, the interlinear, the Masoretic text, they all say the same thing. They all say these names go back to the root of
salvation. YASHÂ: H3467. Lets put one and one together. In no country does 1+1=1.5million. No country on the earth. If
you asked a 3 yr old what 1+1 is they may say, ''75 trillion-billion.'' They don’t understand numbers. Everywhere you go
2x2=4. So, everywhere you have the Masoretic text, I don’t care what 'version' you are using, they all know that this
SHÂ- all my etymology books; I don’t care how old they are or new they are; the references on line; they all reference
back to YASHÂ. If I say No, it means no. No has the same meaning in every language: negative; cant do it; stop it brother;
                                                                                                                    Page 350 of 396

not feelin` you; no; lo; la…they may say it different ways but the connotation is the same. Same thing here:
It’s the SHÂ/Yahūah Hūshâ!

ZakarYah/Zech 12:7 “And   ‫ יהוה‬shall save the tents of Yahūdah/‫ יהודה‬first, so that the comeliness of the house of Dūd/‫ דוד‬and the
comeliness of the inhabitants of Yarūshalam would not become greater than that of Yahūdah/‫יהודה‬.


                                                    ‫והושע יהוה את אהלי‬
                                                 ū- hūshâ Yahūah Åṭh åhalý
                                         ~and Yahūah Åṭh (Yahūshâ) saves the tents ~
                                                           Hūshâ - ‫הושע‬
                                                         H1954 from H3467
                                                              yashâ

Here it is again: and Yahūah shall save = Ū-HŪSHÂ Yahūah. There's that word Hūsha again which goes back to the
Strong's root of H3467, but I want you to actually look up the word 'HŪSHÂ'. It’s the H1954. So this is saying Yahūah will
save; Yahūah HŪSHÂ. What do you get if you take Yahūah, (the H3068) and Hūshâ, (the H1954) and put them together?

                                                  H3068 + H1954 = H3091
                                                 ‫ יהוה‬+ ‫יהושע = הושע‬
                                                Yahūah + Hūshâ = Yahūshâ

                                                    If you take Yahūah + Yashâ?

                                                  H3068 + H3067 = H3091
                                                  ‫ יהוה‬+ ‫יהושע = ישע‬
                                                Yahūah + Yashâ = Yahūshâ

                          All these roots derive from the H3467 YASHÂ. So! What does all this mean?

Probably to a lot of you, absolutely nothing! This is just a foretaste when you begin to dig into this study. This shows you
that Yahūah's Name is not found adjacent to SHŪÂ! This is the thing: anytime Yahūah tells us something; we can go back
and find evidence of this already existing. When we talk about the Branch: the Tsamaq; the coming Mashýacḥ-we can go
back and see the word Mūshýak meaning 'I am your salvation'. Who created the heavens and the earth? Everyone says,
'Oh, Yahūah did!' YAHŪSHÂ created the heavens and the earth. He bore the family Name of Yahūah. Yahūah is a family
Name. In the beginning, Ålahým(that’s the mighty ones) Åṭh: what did Yahūshâ say in Cḥazūn/Rev chapter 1? He said, ''I
Am Åṭh. When you read about that, that’s me. I Am The First and The Last!" All through Ṭūrah we see Yahūah, and we
see Yahūah Åṭh. What did he say? …and Yahūah rained down fire from Yahūah. And then Yahūah, before Mashah, was
testifying before The Name of Yahūah. And then, Yahūah rebuked them in The Name of Yahūah. And Yahūah is saying, 'I
will save them by The Name of Yahūah. Why is there two Yahūah's talking? Remember Yahūshâ said that no one has
ever heard The Fathers Voice. [sic] (Note: I have not found this hightlighted statement in the accounts of Yahūshâ, to be
accurate within the context of His message found in Yahūchanan/Jn 5:37. These men were uncircumcised in heart and
were incapable of hearing the Voice of The Father. Many have heard The Voice of The Father, because they have
received His Word and did what His Word instructed. That is how to “hear” Him; by doing it. For further study, see these
                                                                                                                 Page 351 of 396

passages: Matt 17:5, Mark 1:11, 9:7; Luke 3:22, 9:34-36; Jn 5:37-38, 10:3-4, 16, 27, 12:27-30, 18:37 ) So, who was it that
spoke? Who was it? Every time Yahūah speaks, through that rūacḥ, that breath, Yahūshâ is. That’s how His
manifestation came about. He is The Living Word of Yahūah. We don’t have living words. When I talk, you can't see
words forming. When Yahūah speaks, His Word took form. That’s The Power of Yahūah. That’s who Yahūshâ is.

So, when we see all these things we see that there is a family Name: Yahūah; And there is evidence of deliverance
coming to us because of our sins. We know the way to say deliverance in Hebrew, the true root way: salvation;
deliverer; avenger. We know that’s YASHÂ. And now, we have even more scripture that shows His Name; Yahūah,
Yahūah Åṭh-The First and The Last, was always associated with the SHÂ root. So much so, that we see hūshýʿâh nå, we
see shâ, we see hūshâ, we see y-ūshâ, we see mūshýak. All these are associated with His Name, so when He came to
earth He was The Son of Righteousness. We know that The Father is Righteousness. So He was Yahūah tsadaq.
(Yahūtsadaq) He was our mashýacḥ because we have seen Yahūah mūshýak, Yahūah your salvation. We've seen this. He
was The Deliverer because we have seen Yahūah HŪSHÂ, Yahūah YASHÂ. This is a lot of information…it may take a while
to digest it but I really want to see how anyone could take in all this information, plus the two articles on SHŪÂ vs SHÂ,
and still not understand the power of the deliverance of The First and The Last: YAHŪSHÂ. Its so beautiful how it all
comes together. That’s how it is; whenever you are dealing with truth, Yahūah continues to reveal things to you line
upon line, precept upon precept. Everything you learn is totally supported by what you have already learned, and will
support what you will learn.

I hope you enjoyed this lesson…go back and really dig into this. I want you to look at something…look at all your
interlinear references and Strong's numbers. For all these scriptures I gave, there is one root they all go back to: H3467.

SECTION 4: Chap 7                                 G2424 STUDY
                                                    Prove it!
Welcome back ladies! You have come a long way if you have read and considered everything in the book up to this point.
I will help you look again, as we did in the first section of this book, into the “Thayer’s Greek Lexicon” for a study on
G2424. Knowing how to find and prove The Saviors Name, is key to knowing His Name. Just because our study materials
say that our Saviors Name is such-n-such, I hope by now, you can clearly see; it does not mean that the information is
correct. We have to learn to prove all things. First, we need to locate The Name in the OT. We know that The Name of
Mashýacḥ was foretold in one of the OT books. Knowing where that verse is located, helps us verify the spelling of The
Name in Hebrew. After we learn how to spell The Name correctly, by its original location in the text, we can then spot
any misspellings in any study source we use. The correct spelling of The Name is crucial to the pronunciation and
meaning of The Name. Next, we have to transliterate The Name into the English; while preserving the sound of each
character, or letter during the transliteration process. The last step is to prove and verify any roots attached to His Name.


Now that you are a bit more familiar with “Strong’s” reference numbers, knowledge about transliteration; the deceptive
twist that comes from vowel pointing, knowledge that God and Lord are not affiliated with the H3068 or the H3091, and
you even know the address of The Name of The Branch; let’s see about going through the G2424 again. This time, with
better understanding, as we take each of these steps to finding His Name; I’m sure it will be a walk in the park. This is the
treasure you can hand down to your children! Ready? Let’s do it.



From the Thayer’s:
G2424
-Original: Ἰησοῦς
- Transliteration: Iesous
- Phonetic: ee-ay-sooce'
- Definition: Jesus = "Jehovah is salvation"
- Origin: of Hebrew origin H3091 - Original: ‫יהושׁע יהושׁו ּע‬
- Transliteration: Y@howshuwa`
- Phonetic: yeh-ho-shoo'-ah
- Definition: Joshua or Jehoshua = "Jehovah is salvation"

Six letter spelling:‫יהושׁוּע‬
Five letter spelling: ‫יהושׁע‬

The first thing we need to be aware of, is that this information is telling us that a Greek name “Jesus”, has a Hebrew origin.
That sends out a red flag already. A Greek Mashýacḥ with Hebrew parents. How we ended up with this name “Jesus”, is
irrelevant to what the H3091 is about to unravel. Assuming section 2 has already been reviewed, we can proceed to study
the spelling of The Name in ZakarYah/Zech 6:11:

KJV
ZakarYah/Zech 6:11 Then        take H3947 silver H3701 and gold H2091, and make H6213 crowns H5850, and set H7760
them upon the head H7218 of Joshua H3091 the son H1121 of Josedech H3087, the high H1419 Kahan H3548

                                               Same passage in Hebrew text:

    ‫ולקחת כסף־וזהב ועשית עטרות ושמת בראש יהושע בן־יהוצדק הכהן הגדול׃‬
                                                                                                                      Page 353 of 396

Notice the H3091 English name in the KJV passage, matches the one in the “Thayer’s” definition, which is Joshūâ, but
the Hebrew Name from the H3091 transliterated “Yahūshâ” doesn’t? In other words, the ‘shūâ’ in “Joshūâ” only
matches the six letter spelling. There are no English variables in our list of choices that match the five letter spelling.
Here are the choices the “Thayer’s” is giving: Jesus, Joshūâ, and Jehoshūâ. If we were to transliterate the five letter
name as it is written, represented by the H3091, it would not match any of the name choices given in the English found in
the “Thayer’s” entry! Remember, these two Hebrew name choices are covered in vowel points. NOTE: vowel points seem
to change on a single name when viewing it from a different study source. What a mess!

                           Our 2 Hebrew name choices offered to us when crackin open the H3091
                                                          ‫יהושׁע יהושׁוּע‬
                                                     So which one is the right one?

    ‫ולקחת כסף־וזהב ועשית עטרות ושמת בראש יהושע בן־יהוצדק הכהן הגדול׃‬
Now, do you know why I chose this particular Hebrew text in section one of this book during our first peek at The Name?
I chose it because the correct spelling is within the foretelling itself. Go back to section one on page 33, and study the
screen capture from the “Blue Letter Bible” Website. The deception should stick out like a sore thumb by now. The
screen capture shows the five letter name in the original text, has been changed to a six letter name in the “Root Form
Hebrew” column. It is clear, the suffix of shâ/‫ שע‬has been converted to shūâ/‫ שוע‬due to the vowel points. In the English
name of Joshua, you can see the errors in the transliteration. The “J” has replaced the yad/‫ י‬in Yahūshâ/‫יהושע‬.

After reading section two, it’s quite clear that this scripture is the foretelling of The Name of the *Branch. We can now
ignore the misspelling, and vowel points because we have matched the correct spelling in the text. We have solved the first
part of this problem. The next step is to decipher whether the highlighted name in the Hebrew is Jesus, Joshūâ, Jehoshūâ
or something entirely different via transliteration. The stewpot of names within this reference number can keep you from
staying on target if you let them. Your heart can also keep you from seeing the truth. Be prepared, this may sting a little.
The goal is to gather information that agrees with The Name in the Hebrew text. After doing a transliteration of The
Name, we can look into what the H3091 tells us.

                         This Name is found in ZakarYah/Zech 6:11 under the guise of “Joshua”


                                               ‫ע‬          ‫ש‬         ‫ו‬       ‫ה‬         ‫י‬

                                                 A         SH           U      H          Y
                                                        Read from right to left


                                         The actual name is: Y – H – U – SH – A
                             Can you remember the last thing we have to do to prove This Name?
                                          Remember: the H3091 has two roots:

H3091- Origin: from H3068 and H3467 - the “Thayer’s” reports this in the “Jesus” entry: - Definition: Joshua or Jehoshua =
"Jehovah is salvation" . This has to be proven too. We have already disproven the Joshūâ – Jehoshūâ – Jesus - trio by transliteration
alone. Transliteration takes any other name out of the equation. Holding on this far in the book, we already know that * “hovah” is
incorrect and blasphemous. A transliteration of The Name *Yahūah/‫ יהוה‬has already been done earlier. This removes “Jehovah” out
of the equation as well. Let’s take a look at what the H3068 has to say one more time-- and correct in our “BDB”, and “Thayer’s”
what we know is false.


* “hovah” (See p. 66)            *Yahūah/‫( יהוה‬See p. 36)       *Branch (See p. 77)
                                                                                                                    Page 354 of 396

H3068 - Original: ‫יהוה‬- Transliteration: Y@hovah/Yahūah now that His Name is corrected, lets reflect on why we know the
                                                                                                              ‫י‬
“Jehovah” is incorrect: ‘hovah’ (H-1943) means mischief/ruin (p. 66). The “J” is high jacking the Yad/ (See p. 288)
Phonetic: yeh-ho-vaw'-/ya – hoo – ah

Definition: Jehovah/Yahūah = "the existing One" or self existent
1. the proper name of the one true God/Âlahým reflect on pp. 132-138, for Âlahým and p. 157 for God
a. unpronounced except with the vowel points of 0136 wow! After what we just learned, this one is loaded isn’t it? Let’s pick this one
apart:
unpronounced/Proclaim – this means: “don’t speak The Name.” Try to recall all the things we have learned about this doctrine:
p. 60 tells us about what the Jews say about this; p.107 reveals, we must call out His Name; p.129 discuses it further.

except with the vowel points of 0136/Guard the command – What have we learned? pp. 50, 52-56, 60, 61, 72 and of course,
the 3rd commandment: Shamūṭh/Ex 20:7

                                                   Now, let’s bust open the H3467:

H3467 - Original: ‫ישׁע‬- correct! Reviewing pp. 63, 65 and 335-351 will tell us about yashâ vs shūå endings in The Mashýacḥ’s Name
Transliteration: Yasha`- correct!
Phonetic: yaw-shah'- correct!
Definition: 1. to save, be saved, be delivered
This one was easy.


                                    H3091 is a package of treasure. It reveals: 2 roots inside
                                                        3068 and 3467
                           These roots serve as witnesses to the meaning of The Mashýacḥ’s Name:

                                                  Meaning: “Yahūah Delivers”
                                      H3068 represents Yahūah and means self-existent
                                    H3068 - Original: ‫יהוה‬- Transliteration: Y@hovah/Yahūah

                                H3467 is Yashâ/*‫ ישע‬and means: to save; deliverer; delivered
                                          Consistent with “sha” in “yahū-shâ” ‫יהושע‬
                                     Not consistent with “shūâ” in “yahū-shūâ” ‫יהושוע‬

                                                    Self-existent + deliverer =

                                         Yahūah the deliverer or Yahūah is salvation or
                                         Yahūah delivers, Yahūah saves, Yahūah saved

                  No matter how you slice it, This Name, Yahūshâ/‫ יהושע‬is the salvation sent by Yahūah!

                               A Greek Mashýacḥ is nowhere in this. Our Savior is Åbarý.
The name Jesus carries the suffix, sūs/‫ סוס‬in Hebrew; transliterated from G2424/Ἰησοῦς – soos. This suffix is from the
H5483. If the name is of Hebrew origin, then this suffix must be of Hebrew as well. This suffix/root has no deliverance in
it. Remember, everything about this name must be proven.

If only there were
one Lexicon author
commentary in print
today who would
bring into the
equation of this
plethora of debates
on The Name of
‫יהוה‬, the argument
 that the root
 numbers assigned to
 The Name and other
 Hebrew names
 clearly nullify the
 vowel point agenda;
 shrouding The Name.
 These roots are at
war with the points
which change the root
meaning. You can’t
have it both ways!
These arguments
always seem to stay
within the boundaries
of the vowel point
rules. Removing the
points brings the
tetragrammaton
mysteries to a close,
and also opens up a
fury of disconcerting
suspicion against the
creators of the point
system. What will it
take for a single
author to point this
out?

   Semitic Definition: Semitic language that is both a sacred language of Judaism and a modern vernacular in Israel. Like Aramaic, to
    which it is closely related, Hebrew has a documented history of nearly 3,000 years. The earliest fully attested stage of the language is
    Biblical Hebrew: the earlier parts (“Standard Biblical Hebrew”) date before 500 BC and include even older poetic passages; the later
    parts (“Late Biblical Hebrew”) were composed c. 500–200 BC. Post-Biblical Hebrew, variously termed Rabbinic or Mishnaic Hebrew
                                                                                                                         Page 360 of 396

    (see Mishnah), is characterized by an early period when Hebrew was still probably to some degree a vernacular and a later period,
    after c. AD 200, when Aramaic became the everyday speech of Jews in the Middle East. The 6th and 7th centuries marked a transition
    to Medieval Hebrew. The resurrection of Hebrew as a vernacular is closely linked with the 18th-century Haskala movement and 20th-
    century Zionism. Contemporary Israeli Hebrew is spoken by about five million people in Israel and abroad. See also Ashkenazi;
    Sephardi; Hebrew alphabet. The earliest alphabet used for Hebrew belongs to the Canaanite branch of the North Semitic writing and is
    known as Early Hebrew. Later the Jews adapted the Aramaic writing and evolved from it a script called Square Hebrew, which is the
    source of Modern Hebrew printing. Most Modern Hebrew handwritten text uses a cursive script developed more recently. Today the
    Hebrew alphabet has 22 letters, all consonants. Symbols for the vowels were apparently introduced about the 8th cent. A.D. and are
    usually placed below the consonants if employed. Their use is generally limited to the Bible, verse, and children's books. Hebrew is
    written from right to left. Source: (http://encyclopedia2.thefreedictionary.com/Standard+Hebrew+language)

Shalum in the Set Apart Names of hwhy & [vwhy. This translation of the Model
Prayer is a very basic mechanical translation from English to Hebrew with point of
references from the Greek. Translations from Yiddish (English) back to a root
language (Hebrew) are extremely difficult because so much of the pureness is
already lost. Keeping that in mind, I am no scholar, nor am I professing that this
translation may not have its own set of flaws: NO TRANSLATION ON EARTH IS
FLAWLESS! I pray that this translation serves as a strong building block to assist
you in praying to our Father in true Hebrew. Be advised, the words used for the
Ancient font will differ greatly from Modern Hebrew. Also, when the letter ‘Y’ is
not the first letter of a word…it is pronounced as ‘ee’. Hwhy barak His Set Apart

A trio of eminent Old Testament scholars--Francis Brown, R. Driver, and Charles Briggs--spent over twenty years
researching, writing, and preparing "The Brown-Driver-Briggs Hebrew and English Lexicon."

                                                by (Hebrew) alphabetical order of three letter roots. It was based on the Hebrew-
                                                German lexicon of Wilhelm Gesenius, translated by Edward Robinson. The chief
                                                editor was Francis Brown, with the co-operation of Samuel Rolles Driver and
                                                Charles Augustus Briggs, hence the name Brown–Driver–Briggs. Some modern
                                                printings have added the Strong's reference numbers for Biblical Hebrew and
                                                Aramaic words. Online Source: (http://en.wikipedia.org)

                                                Since it first appeared in the early part of the twentieth century, BDB has been
                                                considered the finest and most comprehensive Hebrew lexicon available to the
                                                English-speaking student. Based upon the classic work of Wilhelm Gesenius, the
                                                "father of modern Hebrew lexicography," BDB gives not only dictionary definitions
                                                for words, but relates each word to its Old Testament usage and categorizes its
                                                nuances of meaning. BDB's exhaustive coverage of Old Testament Hebrew words,
                                                as well as its unparalleled usage of cognate languages and the wealth of
                                                background sources consulted and quoted, render BDB and invaluable resource for
                                                all students of the Bible. Summary taken from “The Word” software

Renowned Semitists Jo Ann Hackett and John Huehnergard are currently in the process of creating a revision of BDB that incorporates
contemporary scholarship. $35 purchase: can be found on various online sources. Some for better than $30

                                          This is the only complete interlinear Bible available in English and is also on
                                          one convenient volume. This interlinear is keyed to Strong's Exhaustive
                                          Concordance. Interlinears are a time-saving tool for you to research the

                                          and this one features the complete Hebrew and Greek texts with a direct
                                          English rendering below each word, and it also includes The Literal

                                          directly above the Hebrew and Greek words which enables you to easily
                                          access a wealth of language reference works that are also keyed to Strong's
                                          such as Greek/Hebrew dictionaries, analytical lexicons, concordances, word
                                          studies, and more even if you do not know Greek and Hebrew. The Hebrew is
                                          based on the Masoretic Text and the Greek is from the Textus Receptus. The
sources of the texts are documented in the preface, and are essentially the same (with some minor variations) to the
Hebrew and Greek texts used by the KJV translators. $40 purchase at Amazon.com

TDNT
stands for Theological Dictionary of the New Testament which was edited by Gerhard Kittel and Gerhard
Friedrich and translated from the German by Geoffrey W. Bromiley. This 10-volume set is a standard resource
for in-depth word studies of every word of theological or religious significance in the Greek New Testament. In
the editor's preface, Bromiley states, "While it is not a simple lexicon, it obviously cannot replace either the full
commentary or the biblical theology" (Vol 1, ix). One of the other distinctions of TDNT is its use of many
different contributors.

What Do the Numbers Mean?
When using the lexicon on the Blue Letter Bible for the New Testament, one of the references cited is the
TDNT. Here is the TDNT reference for the word stephanos [4735]:

TDNT - 7:615,1078.

Notice that the first number (7) refers to the volume in which this entry appears. The word "stephanos" is found
in the seventh volume of TDNT.

The second number—appearing after the colon—refers to the page number within that volume. The word
"stephanos" appears on page 615 of the seventh volume.

The last number—appearing after the comma—refers to the page number on which the entry appears in the
abridged addition of the TDNT.

TWOT
stands for Theological Wordbook of the Old Testament edited by R. Laird Harris, Gleason L. Archer, Jr., and
Bruce K. Waltke. TWOT is a 2-volume set, dealing with the Hebrew/Aramaic words in the Old Testament that
have a theological significance. It gives a short definition to every Old Testament word, but goes theologically
in-depth on the words that would be necessary.

What Does the Number Mean?
When using the lexicon on the Blue Letter Bible for the Old Testament, one of the references cited is the
TWOT. Here is the TWOT reference for the word bârâ' [1254]:

TWOT - 278

The number refers to the entry number of the word. The word "bârâ'" is the 278th word in TWOT.

                      These study sources are not currently made available on “Blue Letter Bible”.

  They are however, available on “theword.net”. These books have been converted into modules for use in the software.
Easy download, easy install. Be careful, modules created from books of interest on this page have a price tag on them. The
              good news is, these modules are more financially attractive than the hard copies themselves.

The “Gesenius Lexicon”, available on the “Blue Letter Bible” site, is an excellent study source when digging up word
origins in the Hebrew text. The list of abbreviations however, that riddle this lexicon in each definition, are not located on
the site anywhere; from what I could search out. So, I went on a search online in other areas for the evasive list. This is
what I could dig up for you new students. I may have missed a few, but this list should get you started.

Bible Linguistics have substantially unabbreviated this version of Gesenius' Lexicon. Below is a partial abbreviations index. One
has to be careful with unabbreviating since for example: part. can mean particle OR participle!

SIGNS EMPLOYED

+ (addition) denotes a rendering in the A. V. of one or more Heb. words in connection with the one under consideration.
× (multiplication) denotes a rendering in the A. V. that results from an idiom peculiar to the Heb.
° (degree), appended to a Heb. word, denotes a vowel-pointing corrected from that of the text. (This mark is set in Heb. Bibles
over syllables in which the vowels of the marg. have been inserted instead of those properly belonging to the text.)
( ) (parenthesis), in the renderings from the A. V., denotes a word or syllable sometimes given in connection with the principal
word to which it is annexed.
[ ] (bracket), in the rendering from the A. V., denotes the inclusion of an additional word in the Heb.
Italics, at the end of a rendering from the A. V., denote an explanation of the variations from the usual form.
§123 = Section 123 in Gesenius' Hebrew Grammar.
                                                                                                             Page 380 of 396




As respects PUNCTUATION—it should be noticed, that since only those verbal forms (or their representatives) are given
in the Lexicon which actually occur in the Greek Testament, it becomes necessary to distinguish between a form of the
Present Tense which is in use, and one which is given merely to secure for a verb its place in the alphabet. This is done by
putting a semi-colon after a Present which is a mere alphabetic locum tenens.

Further: a punctuation-mark inserted before a classic voucher or a reference to the Old Testament (whether such voucher
or reference be included in a parenthesis or not) indicates that said voucher or reference applies to other passages,
definitions, etc., besides the one which it immediately follows. The same principle governs the insertion or the omission
of a comma after such abbreviations as "absol.", "pass.", etc.

A hyphen has been placed between the component parts of Greek compounds only in case each separate part is in actual
use; otherwise the hyphen is omitted.

[] Brackets have been used to mark additions by the American editor. To avoid, however, a complexity which might prove
to the reader confusing, they have been occasionally dispensed with when the editorial additions serve only to complete a
statement already made in part by Professor Grimm (as, in enumerating the forms of verbs, the readings of the critical
editors, the verbs compounded with su/n which observe assimilation, etc. etc.); but in no instance have they been
intentionally omitted where the omission might seem to attribute to Professor Grimm an opinion for which he is not
responsible.
* An asterisk at the close of an article indicates that all the instances of the word's occurrence in the New Testament are
noticed in the article. Of the 5594 words composing the vocabulary of the New Testament 5300 are marked with an
asterisk. To this extent, therefore, the present work may serve as a concordance as well as a lexicon. A superior a or b or c
etc. appended to a verse-numeral designates the first, second, third, etc., occurrence of a given word or construction in that
verse. The same letters appended to a page-numeral designate respectively the first, second, third, columns of that page. A
small a. b. c. etc. after a page-numeral designates the subdivision of the page.

The various forms of the GREEK TEXT referred to are represented by the following abbreviations:

R or Rec. = what is commonly known as the Textus Receptus. Dr. F. H. A. Scrivener's last edition (Cambridge and
London 1877) has been taken as the standard.1 To designate a particular form of this "Protean text" an abbreviation has
been appended in superior type; as, elz for Elzevir, st for Stephen, bez for Beza, eras for Erasmus.
G or Grsb. = the Greek text of Griesbach as given in his manual edition, 2 vols., Leipzig, 1805. Owing to a disregard of
the signs by which Griesbach indicated his judgment respecting the various degrees of probability belonging to different
readings, he is cited not infrequently, even in critical works, as supporting readings which he expressly questioned, but
was not quite ready to expel from the text.
L or Lchm. = Lachmann's Greek text as given in his larger edition, 2 vols., Berlin, 1842 and 1850. When the text of his
smaller or stereotyped edition (Berlin, 1831) is referred to, the abbreviation "min." or "ster." is added to his initial.
T or Tdf. = the text of Tischendorf's "Editio Octava Critica Major" (Leipzig, 1869-1872).
Tr or Treg. = "The Greek New Testament" etc. by S. P. Tregelles (London, 1857-1872).
WH = "The New Testament in the Original Greek. The Text Revised by Brooke Foss Westcott D.D. and Fenton John
Anthony Hort D.D. Cambridge and London, Macmillan and Co. 1881."
KC = "Novum Testamentum ad Fidem Codicis Vaticani" as edited by Professors Kuenen and Cobet (Leyden, 1860).
The textual variations noticed are of course mainly those which affect the individual word or construction under
discussion. Where an extended passage or entire section is textually debatable (as, for example, Mk. xvi. 9-20; Jn. v. 3
fin.—4; vii. 53 fin.—viii. 11), that fact is assumed to be known, or at least it is not stated under every word contained in
the passage.

As respects the NUMBERING OF THE VERSES — the edition of Robert Stephen, in 2 vols. 16°, Geneva 1551, has been
followed as the standard (as it is in the critical editions of Tregelles, Westcott and Hort, etc.). Variations from this
standard are indicated by subjoining the variant verse-numeral within marks of parenthesis. The similar addition in the
case of references to the Old Testament indicates the variation between the Hebrew notation and the Greek.

A. V. = the current or so-called "Authorized Version";

δ *(thel-tah) - known as the ‘Delta’, has a hard th sound in today’s Greek: Thad; thick; thimble; think; thwart; thistle
θ *(thee-tah) - known as the ‘Theta’, has a more softer th sound in today’s Greek: that; they; then; this; them; those; their; the
η *(ee-tah) - known as the ‘Eta’. After the 5th century, the sound of this letter merged with the ‘Yotah’.
ι *(yo-tah) - known as the ‘Iota’- These three letters are equivalent in sound in today’s Greek; making the long ‘e’ sound.
υ *(eep-see-lon) - known as the ‘Upsilon’.

ξ *(ksee) - known as the ‘Xi’ (zie), has the x sound in today’s Greek. The x is pronounced by removing the ‘eh’ in ‘eks’.

χ *(khy) - The ‘Chi’ sound is similar to the Hebrew Ḥaṭh/‫ח‬. The Ḥaṭh/‫ ח‬sound, comes from the back of the throat. The ‘Chi’
sound, comes from pushing air between the tongue and the roof of the mouth (a scratchy sound), while pronouncing ‘he’.

σ ς *(seeġ-mah) - known as ‘sigma’, has a third form: ς used only at the end of a word.
*ġ    - this ġ, with the diacritic mark on top, is pronounced like the French r, from the back of the throat; a soft gurgling sound
   It is thoroughly and utterly impossible- etymologically, historically, linguistically and
                scripturally for any name to sit in the seat of Self- Existence:
                                      -Other Than The Self-Existent One-

                                                                         -Y ʿânah Kathath




YashâYahū/Isa 42:8 Åný/‫( אני‬I am) Yahūah/‫יהוה‬, that is My Name. My esteem I will not give to another nor My praise to
graven images

Shamūṭh/Ex 3:15 And Ålahým said further to Mashah, “Thus you are to say to the children of Yasharʿål,
 Yahūah/‫ יהוה‬Ålahým of your fathers, the Ålahým of Åbraham, the Ålahým of Yatscḥaq, and the Ålahým of Yʿâqb, has
sent me to you. This is My Name forever, and this is My remembrance to all generations.’

Ṭahalým/Ps 83:16 Fill their faces with shame that they may seek Your Name, Yahūah/‫יהוה‬.

Ṭahalým/Ps 72:17 His Name shall endure forever. His Name shall be continued as long as the sun. Men shall kneel to
Him. All nations shall kneel to Him.

Ṭahalým/Ps 102:12 But You Yahūah/‫יהוה‬, will abide forever; Your Memorial [Name] unto all generations.

YaramYahū/Jer 10:6 Forasmuch as there is none like You, Yahūah/‫יהוה‬, You are great and Your Name is great in might.

YaramYahū/Jer 12:16 “And it shall be, if they learn well the ways of My people, to swear by My Name, ‘As Yahūah/‫יהוה‬
lives,’ as they taught My people to swear by B῾âl, then they shall be established in the midst of My people.

   Since the days of old man has cried out to one mightier than himself to escape wars,
  famines, persecution, sickness, enemies seen and unseen, self made snares and certain
  death. It is written in the Hebrew scriptures, one specific Name to cry out to; given to
  man by our Creator. One Name that cannot be detected in the abundance of Bibles in
                     print around the world today-until this generation.

     Through these findings in the Hebrew text it would be difficult to deny: that after
  peeling back the ignorance, coming face to face with hidden errors, outright deceptive
    hindrances and misinterpretations that have been cleverly weaved into our English
    translation of the Hebrew text, This One Name; in all of its claims with over 500 +
 witnesses recorded in this document alone; The Only Name proclaimed repeatedly in the
 Hebrew text, is without a doubt, in its self-proclaiming state of Self-Existence, The most
 sought after; The most hated; The most disputed Name in documented history, and that
            any other such record of proclamation would pale in comparison.

 Evidence found in The Name of our Creator and in the names of His Servants has been
 uncovered in these last days. This evidence has been hidden for centuries within the first
 3 characters of This Name which was and still is shared by all those who live and die for
  the sake of This Name. How important is This Name? Why do the Jews refuse to speak
   the only name we can call on for salvation according to Yahu'al/Joel 2:32? How deep
  does the deception go about this one Name and what does the Hebrew text really say?


    You are now invited to observe the testimony of over 500 witnesses defending the
      Name of The Father and His Son. A name that has been hated for centuries.
                     THE NAME OF YAHUAH AND YAHUSHA
                       This evidence simply cannot stay hidden!

Evidence For The Name: The book that can prove The Name of The Most
High and His Son!
Copyright © 2013 by Y'anah Kathath
Born in California, new author and commentator Y`anah Kathath, aka Shirley Jo Davis/JoeyD, has
studied both in the United States and abroad. She has worked as editor, and compiler on the book
“Articles of the Hebrew Scriptures”, as well as, “Articles of the Hebrew Scriptures, second edition”.
After four years of research on the trans-Atlantic Slave Trade, and the fate of the 12 tribes of Israel,
known today as “Yasharål” in many black communities, Y`anah Kathath has authored the controversial
article “A Slave Trade Commentary – Eyes White Open”.

Y`anah Kathath has written several dozen studies on the Hebrew Scriptures for private use, as well as
delving into the comprehensive study of The Name of Yahuah and Yahusha. She has been a student of
the Modern Hebrew for more than five years. And now, Y`anah Kathath takes on the critics as well as
the authors of old; and challenges in a new way, those who claim that the Name of our Creator can not
be known. Finally, new incite to this age old dilemma is revealed. With courage and conviction, she has
come out with her most dramatic, and extensive work to date, “Evidence for the Name”.

Throughout my endeavor to complete this project inside of six years, my knowledge of The Name of hwhy has
broadened as well as my understanding; and my love for The Name of hwhy has deepened tremendously! My hope, is
that in your search for the truth, you will gain a genuine love for This Name hwhy as well.




Acts 17:11 These were more noble than those in Thessalonica, in that they received the word with all readiness of mind, and searched
                                    the scriptures daily, to see whether those things were so.




YashâYahū/Isa 63:16 For You are our Father, though Åbraham does not know us, and Yasharʿål does not recognise us. You,                              ‫יהוה‬,
                                 are our Father, our Redeemer – Your Name is from of old.
                                                                                                       Page 6 of 396


                                           Think about it…

   Have you ever wondered, why translators use the English letter “J” to replace the Hebrew letter ‫( י‬yad) at the
    beginning of a Hebrew name when transliterating? The yad has a “Y” sound. Not a “J” sound.

   Have you ever wondered, why God is used as a generic name for every religion in the earth?



   Have you ever wondered, where the foretelling of The Name of our Savior is written in the Hebrew text?



   Have you ever wondered, why we are so comfortable studying the bible in the English language without
    verifying the translation in the original Hebrew text?

   Have you ever wondered, why the name Jesus is Greek when the Mashýacḥ’s name is of Hebrew origin?

   Have you ever wondered, why Jehovah, Yahweh, THE LORD and Yehovee are used as some of the names of The
    Most High when He refers to His Name as singular only?

   Have you ever wondered, if the attributes of a name can be confused for The Name itself?

   Have you ever wondered, what the 3rd commandment really means when it commands us not to ruin The
    Name? We have to know what The Name is in order to fulfill this command.

   Have you ever wondered, why English translators omit “Yahū” from transliterated Hebrew names?

   Have you ever wondered, why there are vowel points all over the Masoretic text when there aren’t any to be
    found in the Dead Sea scrolls or the Qumran scrolls?

   Have you ever wondered, why “Kurios” and “Theos” are used in the New Testament when The Name of The
    Most High and “Ålahým” is quoted from the Old Testament?

   Have you ever wondered, if The Most High ever referred to Himself as God?

   Have you ever wondered, why the name Joshua is transliterated from a Hebrew name without a “shua” suffix?

   Have you ever wondered, why people keep saying we cannot know the pronunciation of The Name of The Most
    High, when the foretelling’s of the end days proclaim His Name will be known to the nations?

   Have you ever wondered, why we believe it’s ok to call The Most High anything we want when He punished His
    own people for replacing His Name with Bʿâl (LORD)?

   Have you ever wondered, why the Jews have made it a law to not speak The Name of The Most High as it is
    written, but replace His Name with other names and titles using vowel points? This breaks the 3rd command.

                                                     Diacritic Chart
          This chart serves as a guide to help you better understand the pronunciation of words in this book
                  – Dasia = used for a glottal stop – B al (b – al) (when ‫ א‬or ‫ ע‬is not at the end of a word)
                   Å (å) – Ring Above = pronounced ‘a’ as in “What” – (Åbram) this Å represents the ‫א‬
                  Â (â) – Circumflex = pronounced ‘a’ as in ‘Spa’ – (B ʿår-shabâ) this Â represents the ‫ע‬
          Âū – Circumflex/Macron = together has the ‘o’ sound as in ‘Oh’ - (Âūbad) this Âū represents the ‫עו‬
           Åŭ) – Ring/Breve = together pronounced as ‘au’ as in Austin – (ÅŭrYah) this Åῠ represents the ‫או‬
     Cḥ - the underdot = makes a guttural sound as in the German ‘Bach’ – (NacḥamYah) this cḥ represents the ‫ח‬
Ṭ (ṭ) – diphthong = makes a hard ‘t’ sound as in ‘Take’ (when ‫ ת‬begins a Hebrew word) – (Ṭahalým) this Ṭ represents the ‫ת‬
ṭh – diphthong = makes a ‘dt’ sound as in ‘ Schmidt (when ‫ ת‬in not at the beginning of a Hebrew word) – (MaṭhaṭhYahu)
                                                   this ṭh represents the ‫ת‬
       Ū – Macron = makes the double ‘oo’ sound as in ‘Tool’ – (Yarūshalam) (Yahūdah) this ū represents the ‫ו‬
   Ý – Accent Acute = makes the double ‘ee’ sound as in ‘Bee’ (when ‫ י‬does not begin a Hebrew word) – (Mýkʿål) this ý
 represents the ‫י‬. When this character is at the beginning of a Hebrew word, it carries the Y sound as in “York.” (Yarūshalam)


       Right Half Ring = used only in the case of “aa”: Parâʾah/‫ פרעה‬- suggesting glottal stop between double ‘aa’

                                  *These marks are used at the discretion of the Author*


When viewing the transliterated words from the Hebrew text in this book, you will discover some sounds these letters
carry, are not found in the English language. Some rules of this language are similar to ours and others are not. I have
created the above chart to help you identify transliterated sounds through the use of these marks. Most transliterated words
from the Hebrew are quite easy to read without help because it is largely a language of consonants. But because we are
not familiar with its few unique sounds, these marks are needed to point out which Hebrew characters are making these
sounds, and when these sounds are accompanied by another character. The laws of letters and sounds we have been given,
are chaotic. A perfect example of what I am implying is the letter “U” in the English language and how it is used.

In our language this letter can be used as a Y as in the case of used. Yet the Y is not present in the word used. The first
letter in used is pronounced the same as the first letter in yellow. It can also be used as au as in the case of caught when
accompanied by the gh. But in the case of the o in shot the sound is the same (Caught/Shot). However, if we compare
caught with laugh we cannot get the same sound from the a even though the u has not moved from its vowel position.
We have been raised to embrace an extremely confusing set of laws in this English language, which makes no reasonable
sense at all. This will take work to undo when learning this Hebrew language.

As for the most difficult sounds in the Hebrew, I have tried my best to explain these sounds in writing. I do encourage you
to embark on your own search, on the internet, for sound bites of these letters: ‫ כ‬- ‫ ק‬- ‫ צ‬- ‫ ע‬- ‫ח‬
These characters can be tricky for some people (with the exception of the ‫ )כ‬depending on their ability to hear and speak
new sounds. However, these characters will not create a problem when learning The Name of The Father or The Name of
His Son.
                                                                                                                Page 9 of 396

One particular sound, “Glottal stop” that is common in the Hebrew is also common in English. We just don’t know we use
it- until someone tells us about it. Observe:



ʿ   = a small glottal stop. Example: Yasharʿål/‫ – ישראל‬Bʿâlah/‫( בעלה‬In a transliterated name I don’t use this symbol if the “a”

originates from the âýn or ålaph at the end of the Hebrew name: Åså/‫ אסא‬and   Ålyashâ/‫ )אלישע‬-no glottal stop here-

Glottal stop – “We often make this “stop” in English–it’s the sound we make when we say ‘uh-oh.’
Noun Phonetics.
   B. A plosive consonant whose occlusion and release are accomplished chiefly at the glottis, as in the Scottish
      articulation of the t- sound of little, bottle, etc. (listening to the accent of the Scottish people will help)
(http://dictionary.reference.com/browse/glottal+stop?s=t)

- in phonetics, a momentary check on the airstream caused by closing the glottis (the space between the vocal cords) and
thereby stopping the vibration of the vocal cords. Upon release, there is a slight choke, or cough like explosive sound. The
glottal stop is not a separate phoneme (or distinctive sound) in English, though it is one of the allophones of the t phoneme
in some dialects (as in Cockney or Brooklynese “bo’l” for “bottle”).

The Guttural is a sound that comes from this character: ‫( ח‬Cḥat) not to be confused with the traditional “ch” sound.
It can be easily confused with this character: ‫( ה‬Ha)

Guttural – the sound you hear when someone is trying to violently push phlegm out of their throat.
Phonetics. Pertaining to or characterized by a sound articulated in the back of the mouth, as the non-English velar fricative
sound. (http://dictionary.reference.com/browse/gutturals)

When this character ‫( ק‬Quph) is used, it is transliterated with the English Q. However, a slight characteristic is embedded
within its sound. It carries a “qo” sound. This is what distinguishes the sound difference from the Hebrew ‫( כ‬Kaph)
which carries a simple “K” sound. Example:

                                Y ʿâqb is transliterated from these Hebrew characters: ‫יעקב‬

This Hebrew language is read “backwards” as opposed to our English language. Consequently, that would make the first
character in this name, Y ʿâqb, the (yad) ‫י‬. A glottal stop is placed between the first two characters. That is what this ʿ
symbol tells you when reading Y ʿâqb in this book. It instructs you to pronounce the Y sound, then stop. Start again, and
pronounce the ʿâqb. Phonetic: y-aqob. The symbol over the â is to let you know the ‫( ע‬Âýn) was the character source in
the English transliteration of that sound. This is necessary because the ‫( א‬Ålaph) is similar in sound. After listening to
the Arabic language for awhile it has given me a better understanding of these two characters and their differences. The ‫ע‬
requires the mouth to be opened a bit more with the tongue pulled back into the throat. This takes practice. The ‫ א‬has a
softer “aw” sound as in “otter”. When this character’s sound is transliterated it is done with this symbol: å

As you can see, there is good reason for the use of these marks. They are to help you identify which characters are the
Hebrew source letters in the transliteration to English as you learn their sounds. The following chart will help you learn
the remaining characters:

The purpose of this project is to bring to the reader’s attention the Name of The Creator; typically seen outside of the
English translation as ‫יהוה‬, from the Modern Hebrew (Aramaic mix) script and,                 hwhy from the ancient or Paleo script.
This Name ‫יהוה‬, and most, if not all of the controversies surrounding The Name are thoroughly investigated. The
inhabitants of the earth have been sightless to the significance of This particular Name. During the course of my learning
the pronunciation of ‫יהוה‬, I have learned of many errors surrounding This Name. The online Wikipedia states:

The term Tetragrammaton (from Greek τετραγράμματον, meaning “four letters”) refers to the Hebrew (Hebrew: ‫ )יהוה‬transliterated
to the Latin letters YHWH. It may be derived from the verb that means “to be”, and is considered in Judaism to be the proper name of
the God of Israel used in the Hebrew Bible.

Scholars widely propose that the name YHWH is a verb form derived from the Biblical Hebrew triconsonantal root ‫( היה‬h-y-h) “to be”,
which has ‫( הוה‬h-w-h) as a variant form, with a third person masculine y- prefix. It is connected to the passage in Exodus 3:14 in
which God gives his name as ‫( אֶ ְהיֶה אֲ ֶשׁר אֶ ְהיֶה‬Ehyeh Asher Ehyeh), translated most basically as “I am that I am” (or “I Will Be What I
Will Be”, “I Will Be What I Am”). ‫ יהוה‬with the vocalization “Yahweh” could theoretically be a hif’il (causative) verb inflection of root
HWH, with a meaning something like “he who causes to exist” or “who gives life” (the root idea of the word being “to breathe”, and
hence, “to live”). As a qal (basic stem) verb inflection, it could mean “he who is, who exists”.

The evidence in this book will clearly show the hidden errors stated in the above “Wikipedia” insert. This error among
others, ( ‫( היה‬h-y-h) “to be” ) commonly associated with This Name ‫יהוה‬, is printed in most of our study materials.
Consequently, this has become a deadly stumbling block to almost every student of the scriptures. When I first learned of
this error, I was urged to take a second look at how this word was used throughout the Hebrew/Aramaic text. Then, I did
the same for these characters: ‫יהוה‬. When I did that simple task, it changed my understanding of Shamūṭh/Ex 3:14-15.
One is used as a name in the Hebrew text, the other is not. Looking through these pages, I hope, will not only bring
encouragement to study The Name of ‫יהוה‬, but also give knowledge and understanding on how to study The Name.

I have collected 156 Hebrew names from the scriptures, and listed them as witnesses to The Name of The Father. These
names were ruined; or changed concealing the portion of His Name, which validates with unrelenting certainty the
primary characteristic: Self-Existence. The testimony of these witnesses exposes a worldwide deception that has caused
countless billions to stumble by calling on the name of another. We have all been led to believe that The Creator has a
Name which is tolerant to change. A warning was given through the written commandment in the scriptures concerning
this transgression: Shamūṭh/Ex 20:7

  “You shall not lift up (speak) ‫ את‬The Name of ‫ יהוה‬your Ålahým to ruin it, for ‫ את יהוה‬will not acquit (pardon) anyone
                                      who lifts up (speaks) ‫ את‬His Name to ruin it.”

I have collected over 400 scripture verses referencing The Name, from B-rʿåshýṭh/Genesis to Cḥazūn/Revelation. This
collection of verses, surrounding The Name of ‫יהוה‬, are listed to expose the importance of This Name; which has been
replaced with other names and titles in our English translations. This includes the Greek titles, “Theos” and “Kurios” used
as replacements for The Name in “The Septuagint”. Furthermore, this study will reveal that the spelling, pronunciation,
and authority of This Name; have never changed. The evidence surrounding The Name of The Father ‫יהוה‬, raises
suspicions against leading translators tampering with the transliteration of The Name (for whatever reason) and has
changed This Name into several different names through vowel pointing. These ruined forms of The Fathers Name, and
ruined forms of The Name of His Son, have been “lifted up” (spoken) by billions of people; unknowingly ruining His
Name.
                                                                                                           Page 13 of 396

I find it strange and quite frankly, offensive that when New Testament writers are quoting Old Testament writings; almost
every word remains consistent with one exception: THE NAME. The Name is always changed in the quote. Regardless of
how many years I have been drilled by Christian leaders using scripture, to teach of one name to call on for salvation, I
was also taught to excuse the authority of what was written; and accept many other names as well. I have been taught to
accept a name that cannot be found in the Hebrew text; and is not consistent with the transliteration of the The Name
foretold to be The Branch: our Saviors Name written in ZakarYah/Zech 6:11-12. It is a dangerous thing to change The
Fathers Name and The Name of His Son, because I have learned that the meaning also changes.

This Name, with the meaning “Self-Existent”, is clearly evident in the 156 Hebrew names of the Nabýʿåým (prophets);
kings, and servants of the Most High, listed in section 4 of this project. Many of these names, including The Name of The
Son, carry the first 3 letters of The Father’s Name. The acts of the Masorites, and emendations inflicted on The Name of
The Most High, are discussed in this book. We can learn how The Name ‫ יהוה‬is pronounced prior to Masoretic authority,
by observing the corrected form of these Hebrew names, through the consistency of the Hebrew text, already established
centuries ago: as it is written.

Consider these findings, and what has been brought to the surface. This project reveals; This Name ‫ יהוה‬and ‫ יהושע‬to be
so important, with witnesses; and evidence so compelling, that our salvation could depend on the outcome of our decision
regarding the authority of This Name, the authority of the scriptures, and how we speak This Name. Let’s look at the
evidence!

     My computer software “TheWord” lists This Hebrew Name ‫( יהוה‬Yahūah) 6,076 times in the TS98 version of the
     scriptures. The NRKJV reveals ‫ יהוה‬is listed more than 7,000 times and ‫ יהושע‬is listed 200 times in the HEBm of
      the scriptures. Sadly, These Names, ‫( יהוה‬Yahūah), and ‫( יהושע‬Yahūshâ), never made it safely into our English

 In 2010, after learning of our Creators Name, and how much evidence there was in the Hebrew text; bearing witness to
His Name and the pronunciation, I was compelled to create a graphic for a poster that listed as many Hebrew names I
could find (*having a primary root connection to H3050 or H3068). After the graphic was finished, I wanted to have it
sent off to a print company for display in my living room as a conversation piece. But the graphic all by itself was
incomplete, no matter how much I tried to ignore it. It was imperative to have an “accessory” poster listing the scriptures
the Hebrew names were found in. Far be it from me not to have an adequate answer for anyone who asks, “Where are
these names found? Did you see them for yourself, written in the scripture?” I wanted to be able to answer to the
affirmative, on every name on the graphic. So, I began creating a word document with the information I needed on each
name. I never imagined that my graphic design would eventually lead me into a work of this magnitude. I had no idea
how ill-equipped I was for this endeavor. Because you see, the more information you dig up referencing The Name of
Yahūah, the deeper The Name gets; it’s bottomless, eternal. The ideas from the information I was collecting began to
grow exponentially. That’s how fast a poster can transform into a book when you’re not looking! Needless to say, only
digging up addresses where those Hebrew names were found was not going to be sufficient for this growing mountain of
ideas. The graphic did make it to the front cover of this book by the way, but was only intended to be hung on my living
room wall. Eventually, I would have to confess that I bit off more than I could chew. I hope someday, I can finally see
that poster on my wall.

The world of Christianity taught me of a name associated with the phrase, “It is The Name above every name!” (Phil 2:9)
Through all my years of practicing Christianity, not one evangelist, pastor, teacher or fellow bible thumper asked me if I
could find or prove the foretelling of the Name of the Savior; or, The Name of the Father in the Hebrew text. Now I know
why I was never asked for proof; because they never knew The Name, or where to find it, or how to prove it themselves.
Proving The Name was never a concern in the Christian circles I was in. I even spoke out in Sunday school class one
morning at a Baptist church. I said, “If I only knew where the prophesied Name of our Savior was in the Old Testament; I
would then be able to show people where it is! Wouldn’t it be great if we knew where it was?” You could have heard a pin
drop in the class that day. Nobody knew where His Name was foretold; not even the teacher. Why didn’t I get a response
out of someone that day? Aren’t they interested at all about the fortelling of The Name to even look into it?

Some people believe that The Name of the Creator was written in Genesis 1:1 of the English translation. Others believe
what the Jews teach on this (‫ )יהוה‬Name. Never in my wildest dreams would it ever occur to me to study the Hebrew text;
to make sure the English translation agreed with its source, until a dear brother challenged me on it. It was then that I
realized, I did not know how to study the Hebrew text; to verify what Christian leaders have been teaching me. The reality
of my inability to “Prove all things and hold fast to that which is good” uncovered a gnawing curiosity, buried deep within
my intellect. Can the pronunciation of this four letter Name (‫ )יהוה‬somehow be known after all these centuries?

There have been many documents written claiming there is no way to prove the pronunciation of This Name. I have read
in various sources; the arguments and debates that say something like, we can never know for certain, what the
pronunciation of The Name really is. Too much time has gone by. Too much evidence has been lost or destroyed. The
language barriers are too strong. I found it intriguing to step into an investigation, regarding this debate, and its
documented conclusions. Searching the internet for historical evidence; from artifacts, to the Dead Sea scrolls, to
conflicting beliefs from the Jewish community; became the norm in my daily routine. Later, I learned how vowel points
seemed to be a stumbling block for millions around the world. It became quite clear to me that using vowel points to
change a name into another, and alter its meaning, was quite easy to accomplish without causing a stir.

Witnesses who testify to the pronunciation of The Name ‫( יהוה‬Yahūah) such as, MaṭhaṭhYahū, YaramYahū, YashâYahū,
ÂbadYahū, Yahūshâ, Yahūdah and Yahūcḥanan are just a few of the names listed in this project, that have been hidden in
plain sight. Names we thought were Matthew, Jeremiah, Isaiah, Obadiah, Joshua, Judah and John.
                                                                                                               Page 17 of 396

According to the list of scriptures referencing The Name, there are an alarming number of them indicating; that there has
always been only one Name we can call on for salvation, and is clearly visible in the Hebrew text.(Yahūʿål/Joel 2:32 Acts 2:21;
4:12 YashâYahū/Is 45:21).

During the course of this study, I have found that there are many attributes to This One Name. These attributes, or
characteristics rather, have been confused for the actual Name of The Father in many Christian circles. I remember buying
a book several years ago that was titled something like, “The Many Names of God”. This book listed characteristics such
as, El Shaddai; Nissi; Tsidkenu; and Jireh. These are a few attributes, that many of us are familiar with referencing, A
Name: The Name of Yahūah; The Name that His Son, Yahūshâ was sent in; who are Ålahým. This book I purchased,
listed characteristics of one name. The author ignorantly tried to pawn them off as The Creator’s many names; while
breaking the third commandment. This commandment states that His Name is singular, not plural in form. I am amazed at
how many times I have read this commandment myself and yet; was completely blind to what it was saying. Someone
once said, “Sin hides in ignorance.” It is evident that many are sleeping in this dark age of falsehood, not knowing where
to find The Name to call on for salvation in the Hebrew scriptures; much less how to prove it.

Below is a list of words I use in this book that replaces commonly used words in many Bible translations. I have replaced
them by reason of their origin, and within the comfort of my own discretion. Please be liberal in your own research on
these words. The finer points of this subject can be found in the Glossary of this book found on page 355.

Aside from the efforts I express to prove The Name of our Creator in this book, I share corrected transliteration of names
and titles found in the Hebrew Scriptures. This includes names of geographical locations referred to in the text, as well as
the book titles. Many Bible translations of today, seem to fall short of correct transliteration of names and titles. Below is
an example of curious errors I have found, in several Bible translations, of two names listed in section 4.

First Name in Hebrew:                                            Correct letter for letter transliteration:
‫ – חזקיהו‬This name was transliterated as HEZEKIAH                  Chzqyhu – CḥazaqYahū

Second Name in Hebrew:
‫ – יחזקיהו‬This name was transliterated as HEZEKIAH                 Ychzqyhu – YacḥazaqYahū

What I find curious about this error, is that both names carry the YHU portion of The Name of Yahūah, and one carries an
extra letter. Those who are well educated in the Hebrew, and well educated in the controversial arguments of the vowel
points, still to this day, violate a literal transliteration of these names; even in the most recent translation of the scriptures.

Throughout these pages, you will find that I have selected various authors who’s research on The Name of The Most
High; reveal informative criteria essential to understanding the full spectrum, of why I deemed it necessary to address
every possible argument on This Name Yahūah, and The Mashýacḥ, Yahūshâ.

Please understand, that I don’t intend to impose on the student reading this book, that I have all the answers, or that I am
immune from mistakes, or could not possibly overlook information that could tip the balance in any given subject matter.
What I do intend to impose, is the importance of learning how to pull back an age old carpet of English translation; as old
as the fifth century, and discover a hidden world with a heritage more valuable than our own.

While I type in the last few narratives of this book, I often ponder how I would have viewed this book 7 years ago, had I
come across it; not knowing how to study the scriptures, or know where to find proof of The Name of my Savior. This is a
troubling condition to find yourself in when it is brought to your attention. This skill of study that was handed down to
me, is what I hope will be passed down to the next student; the next poor soul who just doesn’t know where to start. With
this skill, treasure can be found in the Scriptures by those who hunger and thirst for Righteousness. To love my neighbor
as myself, in this context, is to hand down to the newcomers what I would have loved to discover while I was being
shepherded out of paganism.

After learning The Name of The Father Yahūah, (‫ )יהוה‬and His Son Yahūshâ, (‫ )יהושע‬and their locations in the Hebrew
text, I am learning how to love and fear This Name (YashâYahū/Isa 59:19 Ṭahalým/Ps 5:11; 119:132). I give thanks and esteem to
The Name of Yahūah; The Name I defend and proclaim throughout this book; The Name found in, ‘The Word manifested
in the flesh’, sent to mankind for deliverance; His Son, Yahūshâ.

   If the third commandment requires us to guard The Name, we most certainly would need to know which
                        name to guard. This then should compel us to seek it out!

Section 1: Chap. 1



Welcome young ladies and mothers! Prepare to put your mind to work; it is time to get our study on. Learning how to study is key to
uncovering deception in these last days. This includes using study tools which are a requirement and a privilege. This consists of
necessary information that you did not expect you would need, in order to dig for truth. There is good news and bad news. First, the
bad news. There are two things that are required when learning how to study the scriptures:

1. Knowing how to use various dictionaries and lexicons.
2. Familiarizing yourself with the Hebrew/Aramaic language: ‫ת‬     ‫אבגדהוזחטיכךלמםנןסעפףצץקרש‬
You absolutely need to know how to identify these letters and what sounds these letters make. If you do not discipline yourself to get
familiar with the letters of the Hebrew, you will never be equipped to prove anything in the scriptures. Period. Whether you like it or
not, you have to bite down on that. Why? Because the message of salvation has been given to us in that language. We are forced to
familiarize ourselves with that language because The Name of the Father is in that language as well as The Name of His son. This will
demand discipline. The good news—I have prepared this book for you which is geared to simplify this overwhelming task. For those
who are wondering about the Greek language and its demands in The New Testament: learning the letters of the Greek is wise for the
disciplined student. I have created a *Greek chart for you on page 11. In this book, I will be focusing on the Hebrew only.

For those of you who are not new to Hebrew, please be patient. There are new students reading these pages, who only know what they
have been told. They have no idea how to prove what they believe through the Hebrew Scriptures. Please respect this and try not to get
annoyed at the elementary sections of this book. It will all payoff in the end for everyone.

Now, as I take you through this brief study, I won’t be giving you all the answers. You will learn how to find them on your own. This
step by step guide is meant to take the confusion and fear out of using study tools; with Strong’s reference numbers and their
definitions for first time users. Learning to navigate through unnecessary information, whether online or using hard copies, while
viewing the actual Hebrew text will become an invaluable skill. This will help you spot spelling errors in the Hebrew, phonetic errors,
misleading information and much more. This brief study will take you through the “Thayer’s Greek Lexicon”, the “Strong’s
Dictionary of Bible Words”, the “Brown-Driver-Briggs Hebrew and English Lexicon” and the “Blue Letter Bible Online Lexicon”
while focusing on a single “Strong’s” reference number. Let’s get busy!

                                        The Thayer’s Greek Lexicon lists the G2424 as:
G2424
- Original: Ἰησοῦς
- Transliteration: Iesous
- Phonetic: ee-ay-sooce'
- Definition: Jesus = "Jehovah is salvation"
   1. Jesus, the Son of God, the Saviour of mankind, God incarnate
   2. Jesus Barabbas was the captive robber whom the Jews begged Pilate to release instead of Christ
   3. Joshua was the famous captain of the Israelites, Moses' successor (Ac. 7:45, Heb. 4:
   4. Jesus, son of Eliezer, one of the ancestors of Christ (Lu. 3:
   5. Jesus, surnamed Justus, a Jewish Christian, an associate with Paul in the preaching of the gospel (Col. 4:
- Origin: of Hebrew origin H3091


Most of this information is self-explanatory. What students struggle with is how to use this information in their searches. What do
these numbers mean and what advantage do they give me in my studies? Let’s start from scratch.




*Greek chart: (a better view of the original Greek chart not converted to a jpg. format is available on p. 392)
                                                                                                                           Page 23 of 396

                                 Here are two passages of scripture without Strong’s reference numbers:
NET: from New English Translation of the Bible
1Tim 6:14 to  obey this command without fault or failure until the appearing of our Lord Jesus Christ
1Tim 6:15 –   whose appearing the blessed and only Sovereign, the King of kings and Lord of lords, will reveal at the right time.


                                    Here are the same two scriptures with Strong’s reference numbers:
KJV: from King James Version of the Bible
 1Tim 6:14 That thou G4571 keep G5083 this commandment G1785 without spot G784, unrebukeable G423, until G3360 the appearing
G2015
      of our G2257 Lord G2962 Jesus G2424 Christ G5547:
                   G3739
1Tim 6:15 Which         in his G2398 times G2540 he shall shew G1166, who G3588 is the blessed G3107 and G2532 only G3441 Potentate
G1413
      , the King G935 of kings G936, and G2532 Lord G2962 of lords G2961;

While viewing all of this at face value, it seems that the reference number G2424 agrees with the English text. After all, the “Thayer’s
Greek Lexicon” says that the savior of mankind is Iesous, transliterated as, Jesus-- right? How is this information any good to us if we
don’t know how to look into the original text to “see if these things are so?” Looking at the very bottom of the “Thayer’s” entry, there
is something quite interesting:

- Origin: of Hebrew origin H3091 Remember, Hebrew is read right to left or “backwards”

This is a number (H3091) most of us have overlooked. Why? Because we don’t know how to read Hebrew. Who wants to wrestle with
that? I can hear it now, from the younger ladies, “Man, I got kids to raise, dinner on the stove and a boss breathing down my neck!
Where will I find room in my schedule?” I’m sure the teenagers are thinking, “C’mon Y`anah, I’m too busy trying to find myself right
now. Ain’t nobody got time for that! And besides, I haven’t heard anything on facebook about that.” I can hear grandma say, “I’m too
tired. What I have learned from the church so far is what I am comfortable with. The church is not proving The Name, why should I?”
The sad part about that is, most bible students expect the pastor, or the teacher, to dig through all the hard stuff, and serve it to us on a
silver platter, trusting him to deliver to us what we need to know. This way we can all kick back, and graze on all the easy, without
any thought about the trance we are falling into. This is when we begin to train ourselves to think, “I don’t have to work at digging for
origins of words! The teachers can’t be wrong, so there is no need to “check” them or the translation that was given to me.” When
that snare is set, we will feed on everything these teachers tell us because we don’t know how to prove anything we have been taught.
Put down the fear of finding out you may have been deceived all your life, and check the scribes, check the pastors, the teachers, the
translation and everything you have been led to believe is the truth. Be prepared though; the truth is never comfortable. And it’s never
easy to find. Let us begin.


The name Jesus has a number assigned to it, as do most words and names in the Greek and Hebrew texts. This number is the G2424.
We will look at this entry one line at a time:

- Original: Ἰησοῦς - this identifies the Greek name in the Greek language
- Transliteration: Iesous – this is the transliteration of the same name from Greek to English
- Phonetic: ee-ay-sooce' – this is the aid of pronunciation for the same name in Greek
- Definition: Jesus = "Jehovah is salvation" - this is what the “Thayer’s” says this name means. That has to be proven!

At the bottom of this entry, we see this: - Origin: of Hebrew origin H3091
This name Jesus, according to the “Thayer’s”, has a Hebrew origin. This number, H3091 requires looking into. So how do we do it?
What will it tell us?

If you are using a digital book such as “TheWord” software which includes various lexicons, dictionaries, bible translations and
Hebrew sources, just click on the number. It will be very simple to follow along with me using this software. The “G” is representative
of the Greek list of bible words in the New Testament (NT). The “H” is representative of the Hebrew list of bible words in the Old
Testament (OT). When the number has an “H” in front of it, this would then require a lexicon that has a Hebrew list of words, which
these numbers represent. The “Brown-Driver-Briggs Hebrew/English Lexicon” (with “Strong’s” numbers) is an excellent choice. The
first book I used, was the “Strong’s Dictionary of Bible Words”. This book is fairly simple to use for beginners. Let’s start with that
one.

This fantastic starter tool; with built in English/Hebrew/Greek tabs on the edge of the pages, has an English word index at the
beginning of the book, a Hebrew/Aramaic Dictionary in the middle, then, it gives you a Greek Dictionary at the end. The number we
want to bust open is the H3091. Turn to the Hebrew section of the Book and simply look up the 3091 number. These numbers are in
chronological order. Just make certain that you are in the Hebrew section. There are four lines I have numbered for you in the entry.

        (The various colored astericks (*) at the front of any word in this book is explained at the bottom of the page or at the end of each section.)
                                                  Remember, Hebrew is read right to left or “backwards.”
1
    ‫יהושׁוּע‬  (218x) *Ye hôwshûwʿa, yeh-ho-shoo´ -ah; or – this means; the Hebrew name given is found in the Hebrew text 218 times and
is pronounced as the *phonetic shows. NOTE: This is a six letter name in Hebrew covered in dots or vowel points. The “or” means
the dictionary is giving us two choices or two different ways to spell The Savior’s Name in Hebrew. Say what? Vowel or stress points
are discussed later in the book. (See p. 52)

2
    ַ‫* יְ הֹ ושֻׁ ﬠ‬Y hôwshûʿa, yeh-ho-shoo´ -ah; from 3068 and 3467; Jehovah-saved; - this means; the same as the first line- only there are two
                 e

more numbers attached to This Name. Therefore, The Name ‫ יהושע‬has two roots: one root comes from the 3068 and the other comes
from the 3467. Each of these roots represent the origin of that particular portion of the name. In other words, This Name is broken
down into two parts that become the foundation of its meaning. Roots of a name are the pillars, or strength of its meaning. Because we
are in a Hebrew dictionary, common sense would tell us that an “H” would naturally appear in front of these numbers. The “Jehovah-
saved” is representative of the two roots in question. One root number would represent the “Jehovah” and the other root number would
represent the “saved”. This “Jehovah-saved” must be proven by the two roots. NOTE: the Hebrew name here is a five letter name
also covered in its own share of vowel points. But did you notice that the vowel points are different than the first Hebrew name?

    Jehoshuä (i.e. Joshua), the Jewish leader: - Jeh – oshua or Jehoshuah or Joshua (218x) - self-explanatory


4
 See: BDB – 221c, 448a. comp 1954, 3442 - this means; look in the “Brown-Driver-Briggs Hebrew lexicon”, abbreviated BDB, on p.
221c. The “c” is the portion of the second column on page 221, where you will find the reference number you are looking up. You will
find these reference numbers on the outside edge of each column and the definition these numbers represent within the column in the
BDB. 448a is page 448 at the top of the first column. The little “a” represents the first portion of the first column. Now, “comp” is an
abbreviation for “compare”. This means “compare” the previous number definitions with the H1954 and the H3442 in the BDB book.

The BDB has a section dedicated to defining all abbreviations used in the front of the book. It is very important that you don’t let the
abbreviations scare you off, or frustrate you into ceasing from your labors of study. This could be very dangerous. The BDB and The
“Gesenius Lexicon” are absolutely riddled with abbreviations. The authors and scholars of these necessary tools, in order to break into
this Hebrew language with, do not communicate on the page in normal English; they speak their own language. I call it, ‘The language
of abbreviations’. Why? Because they don’t have to use as much effort in typing, and they wouldn’t have to use up as much ink (I
think). If you don’t go crazy first, you will become very skilled in seeking out the etymology of bible words, equipped in identifying
any name in Hebrew by its roots, and able to find the Hebrew origin to Greek words, including correcting errors in your own study
manuals. Bottom line, it’s an excellent skill to have in proving any matter according to scripture in the Hebrew text. The BDB Hebrew
reference numbers can also be accessed by turning to the Index at the back of the BDB book. Really simple.

Now, how do you locate the H3091 in the OT (Old Testament)? We just learned in the “Strong’s Dictionary of Bible Words” that it is
used more than 200 times and it says it comes from the name Jehoshuah or Joshua. If The Name of The Savior is of Hebrew origin, then
we most certainly should be able to find the foretelling about That Name right? (See Acts 10:43) The best place to start is to do a
search on every single time the H3091 is used in the Hebrew text. That’s right! You will be reading over 200 of them looking for
anything that remotely sounds like the foretelling of The Name of The Mashýacḥ. That’s what “studying” looks like. (That was
intended for the teenager who has a habit of eye-rolling their way through life.) If you are hungry enough to know the truth, you will
be among the few (Acts 17:11, MaṭhaṭhYahū/Matt 7:13, 14) who will go to great lengths to search it out.

                                    Below, is a scripture with the H3091 without Strong’s numbers.

ZakarYah/Zech 6:11 “Andyou shall take the silver and gold, make a crown, and set it on the head of Yehoshua/Yahūshâ the son of
Yehotsaḏaq/Yahūtsadq, the high Kahan,
                                                   Same passage in the Hebrew:


                 ‫יא ולקחת כסף וזהב ועשית עטרות ושמת בראש יהושע בן יהוצדק—הכהן הגדול‬
                            (You will find out later in the book why I picked this particular Hebrew passage)


                                                    Don’t panic, its not that scary, really.
                                           ‫( יהושׁוּע‬218x) *Ye hôwshûwʿa, yeh-ho-shoo´ -ah; or
                               ‫* ְיהֹ ושֻׁ ַﬠ‬Ye hôwshûʿa, yeh-ho-shoo´ -ah; from 3068 and 3467; Jehovah-saved;
                             Jehoshuä (i.e. Joshua), the Jewish leader: - Jeh – oshua or Jehoshuah or Joshua (218x).
                                                   See: BDB – 221c, 448a. comp 1954, 3442

The Name in the Hebrew text of ZakarYah/Zech 6:11 is a five letter name in the text (As the arrow shows above) not a six letter
name. If we are to assume that the second name is the correct match in the text, where did this other name come from with six letters?
Why is it there at all? Can vowel points be the cause? Everything has to be sought out and accounted for. We must over turn every
stone detectible in this search.

When I go online to the “Blue Letter Bible” to conduct searches on this H3091, a list of scriptures will pop up with the “Strong’s”
reference number over the name “Joshua.” To view these scriptures, I can scroll down—and this will give me access to all the
“Joshua” scriptures under the “lexicon listing” for the H3091. The lexicon listing will always list this Hebrew name as the six letter
Hebrew name- like this:
                                                                  ַ‫יְ הוֹשׁוּﬠ‬
                                                 (The vowel points are easier to see here)

   Uh-oh! This six letter Hebrew name we just learned (Notice the above arrows) was not a match according to the Hebrew text in
                ZakarYah/Zech 6:11. To add to the confusion, the “Blue Letter Bible Lexicon” gives this information:


               Variant spellings for this word: ‫( יהושוע‬Strong’s and Gesenius) ‫( יהושע‬Strong’s and Gesenius)
                                    So...which name or spelling is correct, and how do you prove it?

You may be thinking, “What is the Blue Letter Bible?” This website, abbreviated, “BLB” is an excellent study tool. Here are the
screenshots of the steps I took to look up this six letter Hebrew word.

(Fig. 1)      This is the first thing you will see when visiting the website.

                                         I prefer the previous view (fig 3). If you want to return to

                                         view to appear. Choose what is comfortable for you.

                                         When I wanted to look up the H3091, I entered the
                                         number in the search box under “SEARCH THE BIBLE”
                                         provided in my preferred view at the left. (Fig. 3)

                                         Notice, under the search bar, where I entered the number,
                                         is the option to choose your bible version. The little black
                                         arrow reveals a dropdown box with a list of bible
                                         versions. Click enter on your keyboard when you have
                                         entered the number, and clicked on the bible version of
                                         your choice.

In Fig. 4 above, the six letter name has top billing in this BLB Lexicon. This six letter name, and its English transliterated spelling, is
emphasized in all lexicons everywhere. Notice where the five letter name is in this screenshot? You will find it under “variant
spellings” leading us to believe the six letter spelling is correct. Make note of the “Root Word (Etymology)” section. That is very
important. Those two numbers (H3068) and (H3467) reveal the meaning of the name we are studying, and hints the correct spelling.
The meaning and the spelling must agree. Now, let’s scroll down and see what other info is available to us on this name.

information like this, it’s important to note that you are responsible for verifying all information that is handed to you by these lexicon
authors. Let me say this: YOU DO NOT HAVE TO BE A SCHOLAR TO SEARCH OUT TRUTH! You don’t even have to go to
law school, to learn how to dig up evidence, in order to compare false information, with information that has been verified with
witnesses. These lexicon entries can intimidate you if you let them! Moving on, let’s scroll down a little more.

This screen shot in fig. 6, now gives us the “Concordance results” below the Gesenius entry when scrolling down further on this
number search. Let’s look at that. I have numbered each line in this entry for you.

                                                           One line at a time.

                                 Strong's Number H3091 matches the Hebrew ַ‫( יְהוֹשׁוּﬠ‬Yĕhowshuwa`),
                             2
                             which occurs 218 times in 199 verses in the Hebrew concordance of the KJV
                                                    3
                                                     Page 1 / 4 (Exo 17:9–Jos 5:2)

 Strong's Number H3091 matches the Hebrew ַ‫( יְהוֹשׁוּﬠ‬Yĕhowshuwa`), - this means; the six letter name is emphasized and is
telling the student that H3091 represents Yehowshua. This must be proven! (See pp. 66-67 on this spelling)

2
 which occurs 218 times in 199 verses in the Hebrew concordance of the KJV – this means; the lexicon result is leading us to
believe that the six letter name is found 218 times in the 199 verses within the BLB Lexicon. This must be proven!

3
 Page 1 / 4 (Exo 17:9–Jos 5:2) – this means; a list of scriptures are given, four pages of them, that this H3091 is found by the BLB
Lexicon.

(Fig. 6: part 3 of fig. 4)




Can you see that there is no explanation for the variant spellings? Seems the student is right back to square one huh? What does the
student do when falling prey to this Ping-Pong effect of information on two different spellings for a Hebrew name? This is what you
can do. Process of elimination is a great place to begin. A list of all the scriptures the H3091 is found in, is handed to you on a silver
platter in the BLB; four pages of them! Look for the five letter name, by clicking on every single one of those numbers in the listed
verses, highlighted in red, as seen in the above screenshot (Fig. 6). When using that search, you will encounter a problem. Every single
one of the H3091 will default back to the six letter name at the top of the lexicon, just like fig. 4 shows. This will prove that THE
LEXICON is pushing the six letter name. The search for the five letter and six letter name must be done by looking into the Hebrew
script itself in each of these verses.

If you have the Hebrew font installed on your computer, type in the six letter Hebrew spelling in the search box. When I did this in
my computer software, “TheWord”, I came up with two locations in the text: Dabarým/Deut 3:21 and Shaphatým/Judg 2:7.

(Fig. 7)
                                                 This search was done by switching from the English text to the *Westminster
                                                 Leningrad Codex as seen in fig. 7. Common sense will tell us that you cannot type in
                                                 a Hebrew word and expect results to come out of an English source. You have to pick
                                                 a Hebrew source text to query your search. Click on the white arrow at the top of the
                                                 tool bar on the BLB to open up a drop down box. This will contain a list of
                                                 translations to choose from. At the bottom, the box has a few choices with a different
                                                 colored background. Choose “WLC.” This will change the scripture verse list at the
                                                 bottom from English to Hebrew as viewed in fig. 8 below.


                                                 Count how many times in fig. 8 below, the six letter name is found in every single
                                                 one of these verses listed in the BLB. I promise you- it will not be 218 times. Count
                                                 also, how many times the five letter name is found; four pages of these scriptures on
                                                 the BLB site need to be proven. This lexicon result is saying that the H3091
                                                 MATCHES the six letter name. Do you remember clicking on the H3091 in red in
                                                 the screenshot (fig. 6) on the previous page? It defaulted to the six letter name in the
                                                 lexicon- right? Looking at the actual Hebrew text in fig. 8 below, the red arrows
                                                 show the five letter name. What is wrong with this picture? The default name is the
                                                 six letter name, Yahūshūâ. The actual name in the text is the five letter name,
                                                 Yahūshâ. WHAT? (Remember, in the beginning, “Thayer’s lexicon” had us on a
hunt for the name “Jesus.”) Wow, what a crazy ride. So far, we have discovered that the H3091 does not match the six letter name,
Yahūshūâ. In fact, the H3091 in these four verses listed in fig. 8 below, taken from the “Blue Letter Bible” site, is proven to match
the five letter spelling Yahūshâ. I personally searched out all 199 verses listed in this lexicon. If you don’t want to miss anything, you
must check all of them. Never neglect any root word numbers attached to any name search. The H3091 carries two reference numbers:
H3068 and H3467. These two numbers need to be searched out. Remember, the meaning of the name is in those numbers!

                                                                      son of Nun is the guy that led the children of Yasharʿål (Israel) over

                                                                      red (fig. 6 and fig. 10) that represents all the “Joshua’s” on this site,

five letter name is in fact, the spelling found in the actual text. All these facts must be considered when searching out The Name of
The Savior. Also, keep in mind that, the “Thayer’s Greek Lexicon” we began this study in, claims that the name “Jesus” comes from
the H3091. This claim must be proven or disproven with facts from the original text.

Its getting weird now ain’t it? The original text tells us what the spelling is but remember, it is shrouded in vowel points. On the
                  following page, I have inserted my own personal assessment notes on this BLB H3091 search.
                                                                                                                                      Page 32 of 396


Jdg 2:7
And the people served the LORD all the days of Joshua, H3091 and all the days of the elders that outlived Joshua,
H3091 who had seen all the great works of the LORD, that he did for Israel.

                                                              Judg 2:7 in Hebrew below:

      ‫וַ ַיּﬠַבְ דוּ הָ ﬠָם אֶ ת־יְ הוָה כֹּ ל יְ מֵ י יְ הֹ ושֻׁ ַﬠ וְ כֹ ל ׀ יְ מֵ י הַ זְּקֵ נִ ים אֲ שֶׁ ר הֶ א ֱִריכוּ י ִָמים אַ ח ֲֵרי‬
                ‫יְ הֹושׁוּ ַﬠ אֲשֶׁ ר ָראוּ אֵ ת כָּל־מַ ﬠֲשֵׂ ה יְ הוָה הַ גָּדֹ ול אֲשֶׁ ר ﬠָשָׂ ה לְ יִ ְשׂ ָר ֵ ֽאל׃‬
Assessment of these results:
According to the BLB lexicon, H3091 is listed 218 times in 199 passages.
Criteria for this lexicon entry claim:
    1. The six letter Hebrew name is emphasized; six letter name is set as default for all H3091 searches; consistent with all
          dictionaries and lexicons available -     ַ‫יְ הֹ ושׁוּﬠ‬
     2. Lexicon lists three pages of scripture for H3091 at 50 passages per page. Last page lists 49 passages. Total passages: 199;
          total pages: four
     3. “The 218 times” disregards spelling in the original Hebrew text. Actual number of times the emphasized six letter name is
        found is one time in the 199 passages that were listed in the BLB lexicon. This one time is located in Judg 2:7 and includes
        the five letter spelling in the same passage. Total number of times the five letter spelling was found in the same 199 passages
        in the Hebrew text of the BLB lexicon: 217 times.
     4. The English rendering of the two names is Joshua and Jehoshua. Both Joshua and Jehoshua English renderings or
        transliteration, favors the six letter Hebrew name ‫ﬠ‬
                                                           ַ ‫יְ הֹ ושׁוּ‬/YAHUSHUA
     5. ‘Shūâ’ is favored from six letter spelling by vowel points blanketing all 199 passages when found only one time regardless of
          ‘Shâ’ ending in five letter name in the original text at 217 times.
     6. BLB does not disclose this information.

Now, remember as I said previously in this study, I had searched out the six letter name in my computer software “TheWord”. I found
two locations: Shaphatým/Judg 2:7 and Dabarým/Deut 3:21. I typed in the six letter name on BLB, and the results only showed
Shaphatým/Judg 2:7. This location lists both spellings in the same verse as we have witnessed. All the study manuals and the online
sources favor the six letter name and reiterate that it is found over 200 times. What does this mean? It means that we have spotted
errors in the lexicon! The six letter Hebrew name typed into the BLB search box is not listed 218 times. According to the Hebrew text
the five letter name is the one listed over 200 times. Does this mean that we have enough proof for the correct spelling of The
Savior’s Name? I believe it is safe to say that the spelling error has been proven in this search. So, the answer to that question is yes.
However, we still have to find the passage that foretells The Name. The foretelling of The Saviors Name lies somewhere in one of
those 217 passages. Here is the struggle in a nut shell we have been cursed with, while digging for our Savior’s Name:

     1.   We begin with the Greek name “Jesus” that has a Hebrew origin.
     2.   We discover in our study manuals that we have two names to choose from; both are spelled differently with different vowel points on each.
     3.   All study sources and online sources disagree with The Name found in the original text
     4.   All the English variables are: Jesus, Iesous, Joshua, Jehoshua, Jehoshuah, and Yehowshua. A grand total of six names to choose from.

I have yet to see an English variable in any: journal, dictionary, or recent teaching manual from scholars, or well respected authorities of any ancient
text, directly or indirectly related to the scriptures, published for worldwide distribution with this spelling, *YAHŪSHÂ. This English spelling
cannot be found in any lexicon version known to man that I am aware of. Why do you think this is?

     Well, at this point, a new student would be tempted out of frustration to either, conclude that we have many names to call The
     Savior, or just give up. But don’t you dare! There is so much to be found in our search for The Name. I have good news for you
     in your journey reading this book, “Evidence For The Name.” The good news is you will learn: where The Name of our Savior
     can be found in the Hebrew text, how to transliterate the Hebrew Name, how to prove the pronunciation of This Name, how to
     prove This Name by the root it carries, how vowel points can change a name, and best of all, how to finish out this study all by
     yourself. That is a fact. However, make note that patience and tenacity is required in this task. Because in this brief study you
     witnessed, that when digging for The Savior’s Name, the confusion increased the deeper you dug. You must understand that the
     truth is buried. It’s going to take work to uncover it. This book will help you learn how to uncover buried treasure. The
     explanation I just gave, while walking you through three different dictionaries, and the BLB, is all you need to get started. That’s
                                                                                                                         Page 33 of 396

    how simple it is to use study materials. These study manuals are just a bunch of glorified dictionaries. At the end of this book, we
    will continue to walk through this study together ladies, (and those of you who are not ladies). I am not abandoning you at this
    point. This section was meant to help you navigate your way through these study manuals, without being ignorant of the obvious.
    Certain things don’t add up in our study manuals. It is up to you to find out which lexicon results don’t agree with the original
    text. You will also learn, that root numbers attached to these names will serve as a witness, for or against what the lexicon is
    telling you. You don’t have to be a scholar, to find the foretelling of The Name of Mashýacḥ. You don’t have to be a scholar, to
    search for truth in the scriptures. You are responsible for proving what you believe though. Not the teachers. This will take effort.
    You can do this. Don’t panic baby, one line at a time. If you can’t find it one line at a time, do it one word at a time.

                                          This study will resume at the end of this book.

                                          Ask yourself – “What’s wrong with this picture?”

Section 1: Chap. 2
Transliteration is transferring the sound of a letter or character from a source language word to a target
language; using an equivalent letter or character’s sound in the target language, while preserving the original sound of
the letter as closely as humanly possible.

Example: Transliteration of Hebrew/Aramaic source text: (Transliterating a NAME: letter for letter- preserving the sound)



               (Source Language: Hebrew)                                                     ‫יכליהו‬
                                                                                           (read right to left)

                                ‫ י‬Hebrew Yad- has sound equivalent to the English Y
                               ‫ כ‬Hebrew Kaph- has sound equivalent to the English K
                              ‫ ל‬Hebrew Lamad- has sound equivalent to the English L
                                ‫ י‬Hebrew Yad- has sound equivalent to the English Y
                                ‫ ה‬Hebrew Ha- has sound equivalent to the English H
                      ‫ ו‬Hebrew Uau- has sound equivalent to the English U/oo as in “YouTube”
                                                  YKLYHŪ = YakalYahū
                                                         Transliteration complete!
               Target Language: English




Translation is the communication of the meaning of a source-language text by means of an equivalent target-
language text. In other words, to translate or bridge the meaning of a word or phrase from one language into the next.



Example: Translation of Hebrew source text:               - Ṭahalým/Ps 2:11 –

                                 ‫עבדו את־יהוה ביראה וגילו ברעדה׃‬
                                   quivering in the you exult and fear in the   Yahūah -    aṭh   you serve

                               “You, serve Yahūah-‫ את‬in fear. You, rejoice in trembling/shaking.”


                                                 OR TRANSLATION OF A NAME:

                           ‫יכל‬     H3201- Means to prevail; to overcome (ykl- Phonetics: y-kal)

                  ‫ יהוה‬H3068 – Means the one who exists; Self-Existent (yhūa- Phonetics: y-hoo-ah)

Bad Habit?

I would like to explain a habit I have in transliterating Hebrew letters into the English. This habit is not a crucial concern,
in my opinion, for any student to begin to pick up while reading this book. It seems, however, to stir a bit of controversy
in my circle of friends. I use the letter ‘a’ between the consonants after transliterating a name from Hebrew to English.
Below, is an example of this habit that will be noticed as you continue through each section of the book.



                            Ålahým is transliterated from this Hebrew Word: ‫ אלהים‬Ålahým



                                               ‫אל ה י ם‬
                                                                                       Start reading here
                                               M      Y       H        L      A




                                                The A is from the ‫ א‬- ålaph
                                                 The l is from the ‫ ל‬- lamad
                                            The ‘a’ is added from the habit I have
                                                  The h is from the ‫ ה‬- Ha
                                                  The y is from the ‫ י‬- yad
                                              The m is from the ‫ם‬- final mým


                            If I was to transliterate without the small ‘a’, it would read like this:

                                                           ÅLHÝM

   If one was to pronounce this word as it is written, in my opinion, it would sound the same, or reasonably close. The
addition of the small ‘a,’ is so miniscule, I feel, its just not worthy of debating. I mentioned this just in case there would be
                a question in the mind of a student who can see that there are only five characters in ‫אלהים‬.
    Yet there are six English letters in the transliteration. You will find the use of the ‘a’, in many other Hebrew words
  transliterated into English, throughout the pages of this book. I hope this explanation will prevent any confusion rather
                                                           than cause it.
                                                                                                                   Page 36 of 396




Names are different because they are not translated: they are transliterated. When names are transliterated, the original
pronunciation is to be preserved when carrying the name over into the next language. Once we begin to apply this
rule, we can more effectively grab hold of the fact that no matter what language we speak, people’s names are always the
same. Michael Jordan is Michael Jordan in every language. Jean-Claude Van Damme is Jean-Claude Van Damme in
every language. We even try our best to pronounce “Jean” as “Zjhaun”, so as to pronounce his name the way it should be.
Names don’t change. Unfortunately, this has not been the case in transliterating the Father’s Name. The Father’s Name
has been removed from almost every translation known to man (almost 7,000 times), and has been replaced with titles like
“lord” and “god.”
Because of our sins, we are captives in a world that does not respect the Name of ‫יהוה‬. Many religious sects (Catholics,
Jews, Christians) have gone through great extremes to mask the true Name of the Sovereign of the Universe. Let us begin
with a letter for letter transliteration of ‫ יהוה‬and learn what His Name really is.
And The Name Is?
“Thus you are to say to the children of Yasharʿål/Israel: ‫יהוה‬, Ålahým of your fathers has sent me to you. THIS                 IS
MY NAME FOREVER!!! AND THIS IS MY MARK TO ALL GENERATIONS!”
Shamūṭh/Exodus 3:15. The evidence is very clear: the Most High had a specified Name that could never change! It is
important to remember that I am using an Interlinear translation of the Scriptures (written in Hebrew/Aramaic and Greek),
and I am writing the Father’s Name as it appears in the Interlinear text. How do we pronounce ‫ ?יהוה‬The first letter from
the Hebrew in the Name is yd/ ‫י‬. The yd makes the ‘ya’ sound and this gives us ‘YA’. The next letter is ha/ ‫ה‬. Ha (when
it is not the first letter of a word) makes the ‘ah’ sound. Now we have ‘YAH’. So far so good! The first two letters are
extremely important because of Ṭahalým/Psalms 68:4, which triumphantly proclaim, “By His NAME YAH!” Some
translations render ‘YAH’ as ‘JAH’. There is no letter ‘j’ in Hebrew and the letter ‘j’ is only a few hundred years old. If
you look at a dictionary of Hebrew words for the word ‘JAH’, you will see the Strong’s H3050. When you turn to H3050,
you will see that ‘JAH’ in Hebrew is yd ha/ ‫יה‬, and renders a pronunciation of ‘YAH’. So, the first two letters of the
Name will give us ‘YAH’ not ‘JAH’. Keep in mind, when you say Hallelujah, despite the suffix JAH, you actually
pronounce it as Yah. As you become more familiar with studying the Scriptures, in the Hebrew text, you will also note
that Ṭahalým/Psalms 116:19, 117:2 and 118:5 all refer to the Father (poetically) as yd ha/ ‫יה‬: YAH (in the original
Hebrew text). Halal u Yah for Ṭahalým/Psalms!

numerous Proper nouns with this shortened form of H# 3068. Gesenius Lexicon; a word abbreviated from
H#3068, whence by the loss of sound at the end of Yahu, then by the omission of the unaccented ‘u’. Either of
these forms is used promiscuously at the end of proper names-Yah is used in certain customary phrases;
Ernest Klein’s Etymological Dictionary 255; shortened form of H# 3068, rendered in Greek as ‘ia’ and ‘ia’ or
‘io’ in Latin; also used in New Hebrew to form nouns from other nouns, meaning ‘a place for’ or ‘occupation
of’.

Ålahým of the Hebrews – derives from H#1933 – huah; Ernest Klein’s Etymological Dictionary 255; proper
Name of the Ålahým, probably deriving from H1933 – *huah.

once in Chapter 15; the full form (H#3068) was also used in this same chapter, an amazing 17 times. CHAPTER
15 IS A SONG.

The next letter of the Name causes much confusion, but since we are doing a letter for letter transliteration of the Name:

                          ‫ו‬
let us break down the uu/ (pronounced oo as in pool). In Modern Hebrew, the uu is referred to as waw or vaw, and has
been changed to make a ‘v’ or ‘w’ sound. Originally, there was no letter ‘v’ or ‘w’ in Hebrew. Since we are trying to get
the most accurate transliteration of the mighty Name of ‫יהוה‬, we must go back further to understand the history of our
own language to see where the error occurred. With a little research, you will discover that letters v, u, and w all come
from the Hebrew uu, and were originally vowel sounds. Notice the letter ‘w’. Although we pronounce it as ‘double u’, we
write it as double ‘v’. This is because the letter ‘v’ originally carried the ‘u’ sound. The ‘u’ was hard, as in “put”. Two v’s
became the way to pronounce (oo), which gave the alphabet a new letter: double u (w). When you sound out the word
‘new’, you would say ‘noo’. Notice on the following page in diagram 1 how the word ‘new’ was originally written...


Did you notice the spelling? N.E.V.V. was the way to write new, because the double u (w) sound was made by combining
v and v. When dealing with the Hebrew letter uu/‫ו‬, we have to understand that this letter makes the ‘oo’ sound (double u)
and is not an actual letter equivalent to the English ‘w’. The English alphabet derives from Latin, and the Latin V (taken
from the Greek Úpsilon υ) represented the letter U. Notice the spelling for the Institute of Massachusetts in diagram 2:
                                                                                 Page 40 of 396

Diagram 1:

             English derived from Latin, Latin derived from Greek and Greek
             traces back to Aramaic, which leads back to Hebrew. The oo sound
             was common in all of these languages.

             Translators have mistakenly rendered the uu/ ‫ ו‬as ‘w’, but it literally
             sounds out a double u (oo). This has created a huge problem! This is
             the reason why newer printed translations of the 1611 edition of the
             King James Bible brought about mass confusion. Words like Leviticus
             were originally written as Leuticus. Paul was written as Pavl. Even
             David would have been written as Daud. Observe this short quote on
             the history of printing and translating of the 1611:

             The original printing was made before English spelling was standardized, and when
             printers, as a matter of course, expanded and contracted the spelling of the same
             words in different places, so as to achieve an even column of text. They set “v” for
             initial “u” and “v”, and “u” for “u” and “v” everywhere else. They used long “ſ” for
             non-final “s”. The letter “j” occurs only after “I,” as in the final letter in a Roman
             numeral. Punctuation was relatively heavy, and differed from current practice. When
             space needed to be saved, the printers sometimes used ye for the, (replacing the
             Middle English thorn with the continental y), set ã for an, or am (in the style of
             scribe’s shorthand), and set “&” for “and.” (Wikipedia Encyclopedia)

                                    Did you notice the spelling of Paul’s name?
                                   This is because the letter v made the u sound
                                            before it made the v sound.
                                                                                                                 Page 41 of 396




The uu/ ‫ ו‬is a literal double u (oo) sound and is not equivalent to the English ‘w’. Ignoring this fact has changed the
spelling and the meaning of thousands of Hebrew words. Take note of the first three letters of Yahudah (Judah) in
Hebrew: yd ha uu/ ‫( יהו‬Ya-hoo or Yahu). The first three letters of Yarushalam (Jerusalem) in Hebrew are yd rash uu/
‫ ירו‬and render a pronunciation of Ya-roo-sha-lam. The prophet YashâYahu/Isaiah also carries yd ha uu/ ‫יהו‬.
YaramYahu/Jeremiah also carries yd ha uu ‫יהו‬. These are just a few examples to show that an error occurred with the
letter uu ‫ו‬. Please remember that the uu ‫ ו‬is pronounced as oo and has been changed to ‘v’ or ‘w’ in Modern Hebrew only.
Now, if I have not totally lost you, let us get back to the Father’s Name. We now have yd ha uu ‫יהו‬, which is always
YAHU (Ya-hoo). The final letter of the Father’s Name is ha/ ‫ה‬. The ha/ ‫ ה‬normally gives the ‘ha’ sound at the beginning
of a word. If the ha/ ‫ ה‬comes in the middle or at the end of a word, the sound is then changed to ‘ah.’ This is why ha uu
ha/ ‫ הוה‬gives HU-AH (hoo-ah) and not HUH (hoo). Now, when we put it all together, the Father’s Name is yd ha uu ha
‫יהוה‬: YAHUAH (Ya-Hoo-Ah)! There are many who argue that YAHUAH is incorrect because the vowel points do not
point to this spelling. Keep in mind that what we call Hebrew today is a mixture of Hebrew and Aramaic.


                                   Let us look at the Ancient spelling of Yahuah:      hwhy




Where are the vowel points? The Masorites invented vowel points in the Ninth Century A.D.; men created new words and
meanings with them. Now, let us look at Yahudah (Judah) and discover how this tribe carries the Name of YAHUAH.
Yahudah is written as yd ha uu dalath ha ‫( יהודה‬dalath gives the d sound). Yahudah has five Hebrew letters and
YAHUAH has four. The difference between YAHUAH/ ‫ יהוה‬and Yahudah/ ‫ יהודה‬is the dalath/ ‫ד‬. If you remove the
dalath/ ‫ ד‬from Yahudah/ ‫יהודה‬, you now have yd ha uu ha/ ‫יהוה‬: YAHU~ AH! A beautiful transliteration of the most
Set-Apart Name one could ever speak: YAHUAH! The Name of the Father is YAHUAH (English) ‫( יהוה‬Modern
Hebraic script)   hwhy   (Ancient Paleo script). (http://www.bookemon.com/book-profile/articles-of-the-hebrew-

Section 1: Chap. 4a

Hebraic words are easily broken down into primary root words. Yahudah (Judah) is broken down into two separate words:
Yah (H# 3050) and Hūd (H# 1935) – Yahūdah. YAHŪAH is broken down into two root words: Yah (H# 3050) and Hūah
(H# 1933) – Yahūah. Yahweh contains Yah (H# 3050), but there is no Hebraic use of Weh: it does not exist.

Words all change with the removal of a letter, but the general annunciation remains the same. World becomes word with
the removal of the letter l. Hope becomes hop with the removal of the letter e. Same becomes Sam with the removal of the
letter e. Yahūdah becomes Yahūah with the removal of the letter d. When we refer to the Father ‫ יהוה‬as Yahweh, we are
saying that Yahūdah becomes Yahweh with the removal of the d. (remember: Yahūah and Yahūdah have the exact same
Hebrew spelling with the exception of the letter d: ‫)יהודה… יהוה‬. This is nonsense. Yahūdah would have to be written as
Yahwdeh in order to become Yahweh with the removal of the letter d.

The Romans served a deity who was the same as Zeus, and his name was Jove (Ioue). At first glance, we would
pronounce this word as Jove in English, but Romans spoke Latin that was derived from Greek. Let us break down Jove:

J – Only 500 years old and came from the letter i, which is from the Greek Iota: (ee).
O – The Latin O is pronounced as the Greek Omicron: (pronounced ah).
                                                      
When linked together, the Iota and the Omicron - -are pronounced as ee-ah and written as Iah. Iah was the way both
Romans and Greeks pronounced Yah!

V – The Latin V was pronounced as the letter U: uu We now have ee-ah-uu (Iahu – Yahu)
E – The Latin E was taken from the Greek Eta: …making the eh sound.
In Latin (a language derived from Greek), Jove would have been pronounced ee-ah-uu-eh: Iahueh, which would later
become Iahweh (as v v became the new way to transliterate u), until finally being passed off as a Hebrew word:
Yahweh. Yahweh is Jove (Ioue), the sky god of the Romans, worshipped as Zeus/Jupiter by the Greeks.
The only Name for the Father, given by the Father, was yd ha uu ha YAHŪAH/         ‫יהוה‬.

Section 2:      Chap. 1                  Masorah and Masoretic Text
 The Name of ‫ יהוה‬has been attacked for centuries. The debates surrounding the pronunciation of This Name, originate from a single
source. This brief explanation of the Masorah is an excellent addition to this book. Without understanding the use of vowel points and
 how they came to be in a text that never had them in the first place, the student of the bible will continue to be ignorant of one of the
 most deceptive practices that has crept into every translation of the bible. As a result, this practice surrounding This Name, ‫יהוה‬, has
                                           bled into every study source available to us today.

A peculiarity of the way in which the Hebrew language was (and, like Arabic, still is) normally written is that it is written
without most vowels. For more than a thousand years, the consonants were written, but the vowels required for
pronunciation had to be supplied by the reader. This is true of the Qumran manuscripts. This "consonantal” text of the
Hebrew Bible has been regarded as fixed (not to be changed) since the first century A.D. and the Jewish people have ever
since attached great importance to its precise transmission.

The problem remains that the consonantal text frequently allows for different possible pronunciations and thus potentially
also different meanings. Knowledge of the correct pronunciation and meaning therefore had to be passed down from
generation to generation together with the written text. Around A.D. 600, Jewish scholars, the so-called Masoretes
(literally “conveyors of tradition”) finally developed a system of vowel and stress marks that also precisely fixed or
established the pronunciation and thus the meaning of the Hebrew Bible text.

The Masoretes at the same time undertook textual research of the highest quality. In addition to establishing a fixed
pronunciation and meaning, they also endeavored to secure the biblical text against mistakes in copying and, wherever
possible, to correct existing errors. To this end, in the margin of their manuscripts they added detailed notes on writing
(orthographic) variants, statistical information on the frequency of particular words, and even directions as to where they
considered a reading different from the transmitted consonantal text to be necessary. This compendium of marginal notes
is referred to as the Masorah Parva (“small Masorah”). Along with this lesser collection of notes, the Masoretes also
compiled lists of entire passages from the biblical text distinguished, for example, by a characteristic orthographic variant,
a particular sequence of words or other peculiarity. These lists, collectively referred to as the Masorah Magna (“large
Masorah”), are included at the top and the foot of the pages of the Masoretic manuscripts.

The highly meticulous work of the Masoretes gave rise to the term for the carefully copied biblical text that they made,
the “Masoretic Text.” Because of their careful work done between the 6th and 8th centuries, from that time onwards there
has been a largely uniformly transmitted version of the Hebrew Bible with only minor textual variations.

                                 This is what this tradition is meant to do to our Creator’s Name:


                                                         ‫ יְ הֹ וָה‬H3069
                                  Equal to H3068 but pointed with the vowels of H430 (Elohim)
    A variation of ‫( יְ הֹ וָה‬H3068) [used after ‫( אֲדֹ נָי‬H136), and pronounced by Jews as ʭʩ
                                                                                             ʤʑ˄ʎ
                                                                                                ʠ
      (H430), in order to prevent the repetition of the same sound, since they elsewhere
                   pronounce ‫( יְ הֹ וָה‬H3068) as ‫( אֲדֹ נָי‬H136)] (BDB entry of H3069)
                                                             Let me explain.
The H3069 ‫יהוה‬, is a different way of pronouncing the H3068 ‫ יהוה‬under vowel point rule. This invented H3069 is spoken, during a
reading, after the H136 is read and pronounced by Jews as “Elohim.” All this is done to prevent repeating or pronouncing The Name
‘Yahūah’ the same way every time, since the Jews also pronounce the H3068, ‫יהוה‬, as H136 (Adonai or Ådaný/‫)אדני‬. In other words,
the Masorites surround This Name with different vowels to cause The Name to be read or pronounced in many different ways other
than its actual pronunciation: as it is written. This is a tradition that takes precedence over the third commandment. This is sin.
                                     The Name as it is written with no points: Yahūah/      ‫יהוה‬
That’s what vowel points can do to a name. The third commandment warns us against doing this to His Name. (See p. 72)
                                                                                                            Page 51 of 396


The use of vowel points that surround The Name of The Most High, is found to be one of the most wicked practices in the
earth today. Below, is an excerpt I pulled from the article, “Origins of Adonai in The Hebrew Scriptures” by Ren Manetti.
I highly recommend downloading this article. It is an excellent read for those of you who are researching articles of study
                                for any variation of attack on The Name of Yahūah/‫יהוה‬.




               After studying the above insert, it might do us well to look at the 3rd commandment again…

                                                    Shamūṭh/Ex 20:7
 “You shall not lift up (speak) ‫ את‬The Name of ‫ יהוה‬your Ålahým to ruin it, for ‫ את יהוה‬will not acquit (pardon) anyone
                                      who lifts up (speaks) ‫ את‬His Name to ruin it.


       It doesn’t look good for those who created the vowel point system and its rules according to this command.

Noun: any of a group of auxiliary symbols, as small lines and dots, placed above or below consonant symbols to
indicate vowels in a writing system, as that of Hebrew or Arabic, in which vowels are otherwise not written.

Section 2:      Chap. 2                          Exposing The Niqqud
                                                 Jewish Vowel Points
                                From “Articles of The Hebrew Scriptures Expanded Edition with Notes”

 The Hebrew language has been corrupted with vowel points, and though I do not use them when I teach, I wanted you to see the deception for
yourself. By learning what each vowel point does, you have to ask yourself, “What would the word sound like without the vowel point?” Here are
the ones I know… I am not 100% correct on some of the nuances of Modern Hebrew, but this should be adequate ammunition to equip you with
                                                   enough information to avoid vowel points.


 Shockingly enough, there are people who exist and firmly attest that Modern Hebrew (an Aramaic mix) cannot be read
without vowel points. The Babylonian Talmud is written without vowel points. Ancient Hebrew is written without vowel
                        points…may these 2 documents serve as a witness against these people:

 As you can see for yourself, earlier versions of Hebrew not only had no vowel points, but they still feared and reverenced
                                                      the Father’s Name:      hwhy

                                         Now, enter vowel points (Niqqud)…

                                                                           Notice the change in the 10th century script at left? The

                                                          Sheva

                                                             ‫ְט‬
The sheva is written as a colon under a Hebrew character and serves many functions. Sometimes, the sheva represents the
‘eh’ sound as in red, but if it is found under the second character of a word, it means that the two consonants will now join
and not carry a true root sound. Here are examples of sheva being the letter ‘e’, and causing two consonants to join.
Example 1: the letter ‘e’: H# 7126
None Vowel Pointed:   ‫ – קרב‬qarab (kaw-rab) – primitive root that means to approach or draw near.
Vowel pointed:   ‫קְ ָרב‬   – qerab (ker-rawb: H# 7128): taken from H# 7126, qerab means hostile encounter. Notice,
the sheva changed ‘qar’ to ‘qer’, the qamets was used to preserve the ‘ah’ sound. This is a definite change to the language.
Now, let’s look at sheva causing a huge change in a word.

Example 2: H# 7133
None Vowel Pointed:   ‫ – קרבן‬qaraban (kaw-ra-ban) – non vowel pointed form.
Vowel pointed:   ‫קָ ְרבָּ ן‬  – qarban (kar-bawn): taken from H# 7126, qerban means offering, or something brought
near the Slaughter place. Again, the sheva and the qamets are together, but since sheva is second, it simply joins the
rash I and the Býṭh (b) to produce ‘rb’, not a true root sound. The qamets makes sure the ‘ah’ sound stays in order to
preserve the root.

                                                   Qubuts/Shuruq

                                                            ֻ‫וּ ק‬
                                                               or


The qubuts is written as three dots flowing diagonally from a character, unless it is the Hebrew ‫( ו‬uu/uau/waw), where it
is represented with a dot in its center and referred to as shuruq. When qubuts is used, the character affixed to it makes an
‘oo’ sound as in cool, even though the ‫( ו‬uu/uau/waw) already makes this sound. Here is an example of the qubuts:
H# 5150


None Vowel Pointed:   ‫ – נחם‬nacham (naw-khawm – H# 5162) – to repent, comfort.
Vowel pointed:   ‫נִ חֻם‬   – nechum (nee-khoom). We will explore the other vowel point that turned nacham in nechum,
but notice the qubuts: cham became chum.
                                                           Hiriq

                                                              ִ‫ח‬
The hiriq is a dot under a Hebrew character. When the hiriq is used, the letter it is affixed to will make an ‘ee’ sound as in
seen. Ebrew letters that end a word do not have sounds that follow after them. Here is an example of the hiriq: H# 5150
None Vowel Pointed:   ‫ – נחם‬nacham (naw-khawm – H# 5162) – to repent, comfort.
                                                                                                               Page 55 of 396


Vowel pointed:   ‫נִ חֻם‬
                      – nechum (nee-khoom). The hiriq changed the nach sound of nachum to nee. The qubuts
changed: cham became chum.
                                                         Cholam

                                                              ‫וֹ‬
The cholam appears as a dot to the top left of a Hebrew character. When the cholam is used, the letter it is affixed to will
make an ‘o’ sound as in no. When we combine the knowledge that we have from previous vowel points and add the
cholam…we will witness deception in its truest form: BLASPHEMY AGAINST THE NAME OF THE SON. H# 3091
gives two spellings for the Name of the Son, but pronounces them both the same way. It tells us that H# 3467 (yasha) is
one of the primitive roots, but yasha is not found anywhere in the pronunciation, due to the evil of the niqqud.
Behold: H3091
None Vowel Pointed:    ‫ – יהושע‬Yahūshâ (ya-hoo-shah) – made from H# 3068 (Yahuah) and H# 3467 (yasha):
Yahuah+Yasha=Yahushâ.

*Vowel pointed:   ‫יְ הֹ ושֻׁ ַﬠ‬  – Yehoshua (ye-ho-shoo-ah). The yad has been vowel pointed with the sheva, this makes
Yahūshâ become Yehusha. The uu (waw) has been vowel pointed with the cholam, and now with the cholam and sheva:
Yahūshâ becomes Yehosha. Finally, the shan (shin) is vowel pointed with the qubuts, in addition to the sheva and the
cholam: Yahushâ becomes Yehoshua. IMPORTANT: Many believers render Yehoshua as Yahushua and admit that Yeho
only exists because of the addition of vowel points. They deny the use of the sheva and the cholam, but they keep ‘shua’,
which exists because of the qubuts. Yahūshâ has been corrupted with three different vowel points…they only remove two.
Yehoshua or Yahushua: both are blasphemy.
                                                          9. Sin

                                                             ‫שׂ‬
The sin dot is written as a dot over the left corner of the Hebrew shan. The shan naturally makes a ‘sh’ sound as in shoot.
When the sin dot is used, the shan becomes known as sin, and makes an ‘s’ sound, as is sam. Oddly enough, to preserve

the ‘sh’ sound, another dot to the shan is placed over the right corner to make it a shin:   ‫שׁ‬. Shan becomes sin? This one
needs no explanation. Here is an example of sin being added to shan: H# 7604
None Vowel Pointed:    ‫ – שאר‬sh‘ar (shaw-ar) – redundant, to swell up, remnant.
Vowel pointed:   ‫ְשׂאֹ ר‬     – se‘or (seh-ore’: H# 7603): taken from H# 7604, se‘or means yeast-cake/leaven. Notice, the
sin changed ‘sh’ to ‘s’, the sheva gives the ‘e’ sound as in red, and the cholam over the alaph changes the ‘a’ sound to ‘o’.



                                                  Dagesh/Mappiq

                                                             ‫בּ‬
The dagesh (mappiq for the ha) is a diacritic used in the Hebrew alphabet. It was added to the Hebrew orthography at the
same time as the Masoretic system of niqqud (vowel points). It takes the form of a dot placed inside a Hebrew letter and
has the effect of modifying the sound in one of two ways. The chart on the following page borrowed from Wikipedia
shows how the dagesh works in Hebrew.

There are more combinations of niqqud (vowel points) that are formed by combining the niqqud (sheva patach, sheva
segol, sheva qamets), but my purpose was to merely equip you with a basic understanding of vowel points. Now, with
these resources provided to you, you can proceed in your studies with an understanding of how certain words came to be,
and how other certain words were ‘lost in the translation.’

Section 2:     Chap. 3




This subject matter has been echoed by quite a few researchers over the years, and includes various accusations against
those entrusted to a sacred text; known to the world as the Masoretic text. What I intend to examine about the
emendations in this sub-section are: the changes that had been made, and possible ramifications this has led to;
specifically, regarding The Name of The Most High. I will include links to further your study on this matter.

First, what is an ‘emendation’ and where can they be found? Who are the ‘Sopharim’ and what role do they play in
relationship to the scriptures? I will answer these questions to lay a foundation, briefing you on the basics, then I will
explain what I have found in my research on the changes to the text itself.

       Emendation – to change, with the intent to improve upon.
       Masorah – The record of changes, or list of emendations is where the term ‘Masorah’ comes from.
       Masorites – known as ‘keepers of the scriptures’ who followed after that of the Sopherim. It is from their title, we
        receive the term Masoretic text.
       Sopharim – H5608: Sphr/‫ – ספר‬to take account of, scribe.

How do you get ‘Sopharim’ from Sphr? To make this word plural in Hebrew, or more than one scribe, add the yod/‫ י‬and
final mým/‫ ם‬to the end of the word. They would not be ‘Saphrs’ with an s at the end of the word like in English as in:
cars, boats, or toys. Instead, the word is put together like this: Sapharým/‫ספרים‬. Sapharým is the plural of Saphar.

‘The Sopherim were the authorized revisers of the Sacred Text; and, their work being completed, the Massorites were the
authorized custodians of it. Their work was to preserve it. The Masorah is called "A Fence to the Scriptures," because it
locked all words and letters in their places. It does not contain notes or comments as such, but facts and phenomena. It
records the number of times that several letters occur in the various books of the Bible; the number of words, and the
middle word; the number of verses, and the middle verse; the number of expressions and combinations of words, etc. All
this, not from a perverted ingenuity, but for the set purpose of safeguarding the Sacred Text, and preventing the loss or
misplacement of a single letter or word’. Online Source: (http://www.therain.org/appendixes/app30.html)

       The role these scribes play in relationship to the scriptures, is a seat of such sensitive responsibility, that it carries
        with it, dire consequences if taken lightly. The consequences are obvious and cuts both ways. To the reader: an
        incomplete delivery of the original message, and a skewing of the truth. To the scribe: severe judgement from The
        Most High; because the scribe took it upon himself to make changes that could effect the minds and lives of
        thousands of generations after the fact. To put it simply, applying for a job like that, is rather serious.

NacḥamYah/Neh and Âzrå/Ezr, were two scribes who have allegations against them in the matter of changing the text. It
is said that they were given authority to make changes to an original manuscript. These allegations are derived from
scribes who came after them. They believe that the text handed down to them was flawed. Consequently, the errors found
in their text, would have come from the previous scribes before them. Hence, the allegations against the two scribes or
‘Sapharým’. This is in reference to the Great Isaiah Scroll and its alleged lack of accuracy. I do recommend studying this
topic out to completion. It really is quite interesting.

The Jewish scribes who are entrusted with these manuscripts, dating back to the first century, have since made several
changes. They felt it was their responsibility to emend errors, mistakes and portions of text that needed clarifying to the
reader. As stated above, these changes have been tracked and noted by the scribes themselves, and are listed in what is
known today as the “Masorah”.

Now, that you have been briefed, I want to immediately turn your attention to appendices taken from ‘E. W. Bullinger’s
Companion Bible’, listed on the following page. I am only going into one of the subjects of emendations (Appendix 32).
The rest of them, I will leave for you to explore at your leisure.
                                                                                                                   Page 58 of 396

Appendix 31: The Fifteen Extraordinary Points of the Sopherim.
Appendix 32: The 134 Passages Where The Sopherim altered "Jehovah" to "Adonai".
Appendix 33: The "Eighteen Emendations" Of The Sopherim.
Appendix 34: The Readings Called Severin.

Below is a list of passages where the Masorah reveals, that the Name of The Most High was replaced. Admittedly, when
the scribe was copying from the original document; instead of transferring The Name of Yahūah/‫ יהוה‬when he saw it, he
decided to write into his copy Ådaný/‫אדני‬. (This corrected spelling of “Adonai”, has been transliterated without the
influence of vowel points.) Why the scribe would deem it necessary to move on the text in such a radical way, is
troublesome; even to the Orthodox Jew who stumbles upon these ‘Emendations of the Sopherim’.

The list from “Bullinger’s Companion Bible”, is not accurate. There is also debate over the official list given from the
“Ginsburg Edition” “Masorah” that follows as well.

                                     This Is Appendix 32 From “The Companion Bible”.

“Out of extreme (but mistaken) reverence for the Ineffable Name “Jehovah”, the ancient custodians of the Sacred Text
substituted in many places “Adonai” (see Appendix 4. viii. 2). These, in the Authorized Version and Revised Version, are all
printed “Lord”. In all these places we have printed it “LORD”, marking the word with an asterisk in addition to the note in
the margin, to inform the reader of the fact.”

Gen 18:3, 27, 30, 32; 19:18, 20:4. Ex 4:10, 13, 5:22; 15:17, 34:9, Num 14:17, Joshua 7:8 Judg 6:15, 13:8. 1 Kings 3:10, 15;

37:24, 38:14, 16, 49:14, Ezek 18:25, 29, 21:13, 33:17, 29, Amos 5:16, 7:7, 8, 9:1, Zech 9:4 Mic 1:2 Mal 1:12, 14 Ps 2:4,

To these may be added the following, where “Elohim” was treated in the same way: 2 Sam 5:19-25, 6:9-17, where the
Authorized Version has “LORD.” 1 Chr 13:12, 14:10, 11, 14, 16, 16:1, Psa 14:1, 2, 5, 53:1, 2, 4, 5, where in Authorized
Version and Revised Version it still appears as “God”. It is printed “GOD” in the Companion Bible.

Below, is the official list given in the Masorah ‘Ginsburg’s Edition’ where Yahūah/‫ יהוה‬was replaced with Ådaný/‫אדני‬.

What ramifications could this cause? My assessment of such emendations is this; it is stated over and over again, that the
scribes were particularly meticulous in guarding every word and letter in the manuscript they were entrusted with. This
was to ensure that not a single letter would fall from the text. The scribes are praised and noted for this badge of the
highest honor in their field. With that said, I would like to ask the ‘Daddy’ of all questions, if I may. What on earth would
possess the scribe, who has been entrusted with a sacred text, to deliberately remove four letters from the text, and replace
those four letters with a different set of letters, 134 times? Remember the job description: “ensure that not a single letter,
or word, falls from the text.” Lock it in place! Also, recall the definition of “emendation” which is, “The intent to improve
upon”.

Now, I may not be the sharpest tool in the shed, but I promise you, I’m not the dullest knife in the kitchen drawer either. I
know a smoking gun when I see one. And again, I ask another question, what makes us think that these “scribes” haven’t
done more changes than what they are revealing in the Masorah? The ramifications are colossal. Already, I can see
through this artificial cloak; of honor and trust, that the world is supposed to rest in, without question. They admit to
violating the primary objective in their job description. That alone, exposes the character of the scribe entrusted to a text
as important as this one. Since this knowledge has been brought to my attention, I often wonder how deep this rabbit hole
really goes. However, I cannot allow my heart to fall prey to doubt and fear because of what I cannot prove. We are faced
with the most difficult challenges in these last days. The information given to us is fragmented at best. With obstacles so
monumental, we find ourselves scaling a landslide; leaving us in the most humbling of positions. The wisest choice left is
to seek His face, pressing in with all our heart. We can study and learn to prove matters in the Ṭūrah all day long, but
when all is said and done, in the midst of all the missing pieces; only those who hunger and thirst for Righteousness, and
doing His Commands will be given the secrets of His Reign. (Dabarým/Deut 6:25, 7:9-13, 8:3, 11:22, 13:3-4, 15:5, 16:20, 24:13, 28:15;
MaṭhaṭhYahū/Matt 5:6, 19, 7:21-24, 13:1-52; Luke 8:10-21, 11:28; Mark 4:20; Shamūʿål Býṭh/2Sam 8:15; Ṭahalým/Ps 4:5, 44:21, 111:1-10;
Yahūʿål/Joel 2:11; Danýʿål/Dan 2:47; Cḥazūn/Rev 7:16)


In order to do Righteousness, we first must find out what Yahūah declares is Righteousness. This is a study all in itself.
Uncovering the truth about what He said about His Name is a good place to start. Yes, I am suspicious of these
shenanigans regarding the removal of The Name. How many strokes of the pen does it take to remove The Name of ‫יהוה‬
from the ancient text? The world may never know.

It is important to note, that Yahūah allowed this text to be placed in the hands of the Gentiles (Ashkenazim). This
important text among others that were destroyed, used to be in the hands of the house of Yasharʿål and Yahūdah. They
have been exiled from the land and were put on ships during the 16th and 18th centuries; forced into slavery to serve their
enemies. Why? Because they refused to serve Yahūah. This was their punishment for their treachery against the Right-
Rulings of Yahūah. They were made to be slaves to the entire world. We, who are coming into this knowledge now
understand, that this text has been removed from Yasharʿål, because they were seen by Yahūah as untrustworthy to bear
His Name or His Laws; more than the heathen. This text, contains the family accounts of those slaves who were exiled. It
is their heritage. As controversial as this statement is, and quite offensive I am sure, all the nations are now put under a
frightening reality. Understanding of this text can be obtained through The Voice of Yahūah only (Åmūs/Amos 8:11-
12;YashâYahū/Isa 8:16-17) This forces the hand and heart of every single individual to seek Him directly. Not through a
man, a voice behind a pulpit, or in the land of Yasharʿål (Israel). What did Yahūah already say? What is the message in
the text that He desires us to hear that His own people refused? Without this “pressing in” that is required of us, we will
remain ignorant and ensnared by our own deceptive hearts. Consequently, this will bring His Wrath against those who
refuse to inquire of Him (TsaphanYah/Zeph 1:1-7).

Section 2: Chap 4

                            -The Jews claim that… this Name is the “Un-Utterable Name”-

One of the maladies of modern Judaism is the strict prohibition against uttering The Name of the Creator. The modern
rabbinic law code Mishnah Berurah explains:

                        It is forbidden to read the glorious and terrible Name as it is written, as the
                      Sages said, “He that pronounces The Name as it is written has no portion in the
                   World to come”. Therefore it must be read as if it were written Ådaný /‫( אדני‬Adonai)
                    (Mishnah Berurah 5:2) Online Source: “The Ban on the Divine Name” pdf- by Nehemia Gordon


                                -The Jews claim that… “The Creator has many Names”-

“I have often heard people refer to the Judeo-Christian God as “The Nameless God” to contrast our God with the ancient
pagan gods. I always found this odd, because Judaism clearly recognizes the existence of a Name for God; in fact, we
have many Names for God.” Some people render the four-letter Name as “Jehovah,” but this pronunciation is
particularly unlikely. The word “Jehovah” comes from the fact that ancient Jewish texts used to put the vowels of The
Name “Adonai” (the usual substitute for YHVH) under the consonants of YHVH to remind people not to pronounce YHVH
as written. A sixteenth century German Christian scribe, while transliterating the Bible into Latin for the Pope, wrote The
Name out as it appeared in his texts, with the consonants of YHVH and the vowels of Adonai, and came up with the
word JeHoVaH (“J” is pronounced “Y” in German), and The Name stuck.”

                                                     The Jews claim that …

  Nothing in the Torah prohibits a person from pronouncing The Name of God. Indeed, it is evident from scripture that
  God’s Name was pronounced routinely. Many common Hebrew Names contain “Yah” or “Yahu,” part of God’s four-
                    letter Name. The Name was pronounced as part of daily services in the Temple.

   The Mishnah confirms that there was no prohibition against pronouncing The Name in ancient times. In fact, the
 Mishnah recommends using God’s Name as a routine greeting to a fellow Jew. Berakhot 9:5. However, by the time of
the Talmud (Babylonian Talmud), it was a custom to use substitute Names for God. Some rabbis asserted that a person
 who pronounces YHVH according to its letters (instead of using a substitute) has no place in the World to Come, and
  should be put to death. Instead of pronouncing the four-letter Name, we usually substitute The Name “Adonai,” or
                                        simply say “Ha-Shem” (lit. The Name).

 If the Creator of all things makes a statement of any kind on any matter, especially concerning His Own Name, would it not be more
                                     trustworthy of a saying than any opinion, or tradition of man?

Section 2: Chap 4a                           The Jewish Tradition
                    Oral Torah: The Talmud

                    In addition to the Written Scriptures we have an “Oral Torah,” a tradition explaining what the
                    scriptures mean and how to interpret them and apply the Laws. Orthodox Jews believe G-d taught
                    the Oral Torah to Moses, and he taught it to others, down to the present day. This tradition was
                    maintained only in oral form until about the second century C.E., when the oral law was compiled
                    and written down in a document called the “Mishnah.”

                  Over the next few centuries, additional commentaries elaborating on the Mishnah were written
down in Jerusalem and Babylon. These additional commentaries are known as the Gemara. The Gemara and the
Mishnah together are known as the Talmud. This was completed in the 5th century C.E.

There are actually two Talmud’s: the Jerusalem Talmud and the Babylonian Talmud. The Babylonian Talmud is more
comprehensive, and is the one most people mean if they just say “the Talmud” without specifying which one.

The Talmud is not easy to read. It reminds me of someone else’s class notes for a college lecture you never attended.
There are often gaps in the reasoning where it is assumed that you already know what they are talking about, and
concepts are often expressed in a sort of shorthand. Biblical verses that support a teaching are often referenced by only
two or three words. The Talmud preserves a variety of views on every issue, and does not always clearly identify which
view is the accepted one. (http://www.jewfaq.org/torah.htm#Talmud)

                                                     In conclusion …

GD (God) -   ‫גד‬                                                                                  Ådaný - ‫( אדני‬Adonai)

Assuming these (names or titles) are a reasonable alternative, the Jews are under the belief that these titles reference the
Creator without offence to Him, according to their written code (Mishnah Berurah 5:2). They believe they are sufficient to
use in place of His actual Name, ‫( יהוה‬Yahūah). They claim this practice will help avoid the risk of erasing or defacing His
  Name in spite of the 3rd commandment spoken of by Yahūah in the Ṭūrah. It is this tradition that should raise concern
                                      about the vowel point system. (review pp. 52-56)

included the Ya or Yahū portion of The Name ‫יהוה‬. The list begins with the name of Yashūâ or Yeshūâ. I will begin with
this name first; because it is said to be The Name of Mashýacḥ. With a little research the confusion that surrounds this
Yiddish form of The Name of Mashýacḥ is clearly exposed. Errors in the “Strong’s Dictionary of Bible Words” and the
“Brown Driver Briggs Hebrew and English Lexicon” are also exposed. This is a lesson on how to identify errors in
Hebrew names by the roots they carry. This section gives a step by step look at how The Name of Yahūshâ ended up with
the “shūâ/‫ ”שוע‬suffix and how many other names became corrupted as well.

Page Navigation:

The corrupted/Yiddish name found in the Hebrew text is listed in yellow to the far left of the page. Its corresponding
reference number and corrected Hebrew spelling found in the “Brown Driver Briggs Hebrew/English Lexicon” follows to
the right. An address is listed above each Yiddish name for your convenience. These names are found in various scriptures
throughout this book. The page numbers where these names are found are also listed to the right of the scripture address.
Since some of the information found in our study materials is misleading, I have made the necessary corrections for you to
view and research on your own. Any name found with a line through it is the Yiddish/incorrect form. It is important to
note the missing Hebrew characters, and additional Hebrew characters, that have been added to these names because of
vowel points. Hence the term: corrupted. A transliteration table has been inserted into each corrupted name section.

After the first Yiddish name listed, lesson notes have been added. These notes will help explain errors and uncover the
deception surrounding many false names leading us away from The Name of Yahūshâ. After a brief narrative, the list of
corrupted names resume on page 68.




                            ‫נראשית‬

   And to Shaṭh, he also brought forth a son, and he called ‫ את‬his name Anūsh. At that time, men [began to]
                                  corruptly call(ed) on The Name of hwhy.
     (With further study, you will find how the word “corruptly” was overlooked in the translation. Look at “began” in Hebrew)

  The first corrupted name is Yeshūâ. After digesting the narrative that follows the transliteration table, you should be able to better
                           understand how the roots of these names prove the corruption evident in them.

At the heart of learning the true Name for the Mashýacḥ, Yeshua seems to be one of the names that Messianic practitioners aspire to. I
too once used the name Yeshua, but who was Yeshua? We must prove all things…so have you ever proven Yeshua?

Hebrew
        1.    ‫ ישוע‬Yeshua (H-3442): he will save? Strong’s links the root of Yeshua back to H-3091: proven to be
              Yahusha. This would make Yeshua a form of the Name of Mashýacḥ. H-3091 reveals that the primary roots for
              Yahusha are H-3068 – Yahuah, and H-3467 – yasha: the root for Yeshua is not found in H-3091, because it is a
              shortened form that only came to be because of captivity. This is why finding a Hebraic origin of Yeshua is
              impossible. The Ernest Klein Etymological Dictionary of the Hebrew language does not list Yeshua as a Hebrew
              word. Etymology: Brown Driver Briggs (BDB) pg. 221c…Yeshua came to be associated with H-3467 – yasha.
              Page 1096b reveals that Yeshua is a proper, masculine noun – This section of the BDB is 100% Aramaic. Yeshua
              as a name was only used during and after Babylonian captivity, when Yasharʿål learned the language of the
              Chaldeans ‫דניאל‬/Daniel 1:1-4.

        2.    ‫שוע‬          shua (H-7768): to be free, but only reflectively, to cry or halloo for help.


        3.    ‫ישוע‬    Yeshua (H-3443): Aramaic of H-3442
        4.    ‫ישועה‬   yashu`ah (H-3444): feminine passive participle of H-3467. Used abstractly (existing in thought or as
           an idea but not having a physical or concrete existence) for deliverance, salvation, aid, and saving. Etymology
           reveals that yashu`ah is the collateral form of H-8668 – tashu`ah.
        5. ‫תישועה‬      tashu`ah (H-8668): from H-7768 (shua) in the sense of H-3467 (sha).
                                                                                                               Page 64 of 396

                                             -The Morph From Yahusha to Jesus-
                                              From Hebrew to Greek to Aramaic

1. Yahusha has a spelling of yad ha uu shan ayn: [vwhy.This is the true Hebrew spelling.
2. During Babylonian captivity, [vwhy.was changed to yad shan uu ayn: ‫ –ישוע‬Yeshua (Aramaic).
3. As the Aramaic language (now called Modern Hebrew) was translated into Greek, certain letters and sounds did not
exist in the Greek, so they had to do the best transliteration to preserve the sound. Not the sound of [vwhy,but the
sound of the name given in slavery: Yeshua.
4. The Greek Iota (Ιι) derived from the Hebrew yad (‫ )י‬and made an ‘ee’ sound. To preserve the sound of ‘eh’ as in
Ye-shua, the Greeks used the ‘eta’ (Ηη): Yeshua (‫ = )ישוע‬Ιη-           ‫(שוע‬Ieshua). This is pronounced ee-eh-shoo-ah (Ie-
shua).
5. The Greeks did not possess a ‘sh’ sound, like the Hebrew shan (‫ )ש‬so the sigma (σς) reigned in its place: Yeshua
(‫ = )ישוע‬Ιησ- ‫(וע‬Ies-ua). This is pronounced ee-eh-soo-ah (Ies-ua).
6. The Greeks combined their omicron (Οο) and upsilon (Υυ) to make the uu sound found in the Hebrew uu (‫)ו‬:
Yeshua (‫ = )ישוע‬Ιησου- ‫(ע‬Iesou-ah). This is pronounced ee-eh-soo-ah (Iesou-ah).
7. The sound of the ayn (‫ )ע‬is not found in the Greek language, so the ayn was replaced with the final sigma (ς) to
represent masculinity: Yeshua (‫ = )ישוע‬Ιησους. Pronounced as ee-ehsooce, (G# 2424) this transliterated form of
Yeshua continued to morph.
8. Yeshua=Iesous: The crossover from Greek to Latin was smooth. The Iota remained, but the Latin language used the
letter Vv to represent the uu sound: Yeshua (‫ = )ישוע‬Iesous (Ιησους) = Ιesvs, but wait, still morphing.



9. Yeshua=Iesous=Iesvs: Latin to English was nasty. As the letter Jj came into existence from the Iota (the letter Ii),
the letter u (from the upsilon) was used opposed to v, although v made the u sound: Yeshua = Iesous = Iesvs = Jesus…
                                                                                                                           Page 65 of 396

10. Jesus: they cried out. Jesus, the anti-Mashýacḥ is nothing more than a gross transliteration of Yeshua, which was
given in slavery to blaspheme the true Name of Yahusha/[vwhy.When the Hebrews disobeyed Yahuah/ hwhy,He sent
them into Babylonian captivity, where His Name was corrupted and changed to Yeshua as an insult. In 2012, still in
Babylonian captivity, Yeshua has been given a new Yiddish form (Jesus), but still carries the overall purpose: to remove
His Name from our heritage and keep our identity hidden. Yeshua has followed us from old Babylon to new Babylon:
Yeshua, Iesous, Iesvs, Iesus, Iesu, Y’shua, Jesus, and Hesus…all the exact same name.
Who Is Yeshua? Jesus Christ.

                                         Explaining Shua vs. Sha suffix on the name
                  Online Source: “Articles of The Hebrew Scriptures- Expanded Edition with Notes” Shua vs. Sha pp. 46-49
                         (http://www.bookemon.com/book-profile/articles-of-the-hebrew-scriptures/488643)

There is a major problem with any of the shua endings of the Savior’s Name. Shua (H-7769) is a term that means to
scream or cry out. Although many feel that shua somehow means salvation; it does not. Sha (H-3467) is a primitive root
(written as Yasha), and is the masculine form of shua. Sha means to make free, deliverer or Savior. Shua and Sha are
truly enemies! Notice the names Al-yasha (Elisha the Prophet) and Al-yashua (Elishua son of David). Elisha’s name
means, “Alahym is Savior,” while Elishua means “Alahym of supplication.” As you can easily see, there are huge
differences between shua and sha. Although the Strong’s Concordance lists sha as yasha, it is found throughout Scripture
as an individual word for salvation. Shmuʿål Býth/II Samuel 22:3 makes frequent use of the sha root:


        ‫אלהי צורי אחסה־בו מגני וקרן ישעי משגבי ומנוסי משעי מחמס תשעני׃‬
             My Mighty One is my Rock, I take refuge in Him, He is my shield and the strength of my salvation
            (yasha). My High Tower and my refuge, my Savior (masha), from violence you do save (tasha) me.


Dabarým/Deuteronomy 33:29 uses the sha root alone for salvation, opposed to yasha:

   ‫אשריך ישראל מי כמוך עם נושע ביהוה מגן עזרך ואשר־חרב גאותך ויכחשו איביך לך‬
                            ‫ואתה על־במותימו תדרך׃ ס‬
Favored are you Yasharʿål/Israel! Who is like you? A people saved (sha) by hwhythe shield of your help, and He who is
the sword of your excellency! And your enemies are subdued for you, and you tread down their high places.

There are hundreds of scriptures showing H# 3467 (sha) stands as an individual word. There was only One Name
given by the Father for Him and the Son. Only one Name given under heaven by which we can be saved (Acts 4:12). I
cannot stress this enough: we must know the One Name, and we must find the use of that One Name in Scripture! At this
point, we can easily break down and discard any of the names for YAHUSHA that are not yd ha uu shan ayn ‫יהושע‬, or
that end with the shua suffix. Let us look at a list of ‘shua’ names that try but fall very short of        ‫יהושע‬/YAHŪSHA.

YAHŪSHA (‫ )יהושע‬vs. Yeshua (‫)ישוע‬
Yeshua (the Aramaic Y’shua) is the alleged Jewish Messiah and can only be a real word in Modern Hebrew by way of
Jewish influence of the language. Where does the Jewish Yeshua come from? Since we know the spelling of the
Mashýacḥ’s Name is yd ha uu shan ayn ‫יהושע‬, what is the Hebrew spelling of Yeshua? The spelling of Yeshua is yd
shan uu ayn ‫ ישוע‬and is pronounced Ya-shua. Yashua/Yeshua does not contain the Yahu                     ‫ יהו‬portion of the Father’s
                                                                                                          Page 66 of 396

Name (Yahūcḥanan/Jn 5:43). Yashua (H-3442) only appears in the Hebrew text 29 times. The definition posed to us by
H-3442 is ‘he will save,’ but I have already shown that the shua suffix does not mean salvation: it means to cry. The
actual definition for Yashua/Yeshua is ‘he cries.’ The King James Bible renders Yashua/Yeshua as Jeshua and there is no
reference in any of the Hebrew texts that this name was ever associated with Mashýacḥ.
The Jews pronounce ‫ ישוע‬as Yeshua because, with their vowel pointed system, they assign an ‘e’ behind the yd to avoid
the repetition of ‘Ya’. This in turn renders Ye opposed to Ya. Yashua/Yeshua came into existence after the Hebrews
returned from captivity in Babylon, and obviously, the language had undergone a few changes. Âzarå/Ezra 2:1-2
introduced us to the name Yashua/Yeshua for the first time. Âzarå/Ezra 3:2 shows that Yahusha/Joshua the son of
Yahutzdak’s name was now written and pronounced as Yashua/Yeshua. Though the pronunciation and written
characters of Yahusha (Joshua’s Hebrew name) changed to Yashua/Yeshua during captivity by men, his name was
given in its pure form (YAHŪSHA) when the prophesy was foretold in ZakarYah/Zachariah 6: NO PROPHESY
OF THE MASHÝACḤ EVER INCLUDED THE BABYLONIAN SPELLING OF Yashua/Yeshua. There is no
reason for us to take the name Yashua/Yeshua and apply it to anything dealing with YAHŪSHA.

YAHŪSHA (‫ )יהושע‬vs. Yahshua (‫)יהשוע‬
Some refer to the Jewish Yashua/Yeshua as Yah-shua. Yahshua is spelled yd ha shan uu ayn ‫יהושע‬. The implication
made here is that the Jewish Yashua/Yeshua should be pronounced as YAHshua because of the yd ‫י‬, but the yd only
makes the ‘Ya’ sound. We would need to apply ha‫ ה‬to get ‫‘ יה‬YAH’. Yahshua does not contain the Yahu ‫ יהו‬portion
of the Father’s Name (Yahūcḥanan/John 5:43). The spelling of Yahshua ‫ יהשוע‬is not found anywhere in
Scripture and does not exist in any Hebrew literature.

Every letter of the Hebrew language is essential for giving words of life. Hebrew is a living language. When we
breakdown the weird spelling of Yahshua, ha   ‫ ה‬and shan ‫ ש‬are back to back: ‫( הש‬Hsh). In Hebrew, two consonants
together would give a full sound. Ha and the shan ‫ הש‬would make hash, so at best, ‫ – יהשוע‬Yahshua – would be Ya-
hash-oo-ah (Yahashua). We are now left with another unknown word in Hebrew. You have already seen from the
scripture in ZakarYah/Zachariah 6:11-12, the Savior’s Name is YAHUSHA (‫)יהושע‬. Any other name must be found in
SCRIPTURE, and must be proven to be about Mashýacḥ. It is highly possible that Yahshua has been mistakenly
transliterated as Yashu’ah. Yashu’ah is the feminine passive Hebrew word for deliverance (H-3444), but does not contain
the Name of Mashýacḥ and never referred to Him in Scripture. Yahshua is not a real word: it is a wicked hybrid that
blasphemes the Name of the Savior.

YAHŪSHA (‫ )יהושע‬vs. Yahushua (‫)יהושוע‬
It is common knowledge that Joshua in Hebrew was spelled the same way as Mashýacḥ: YAHŪSHA ‫יהושע‬. The
problem is that the transliterations for Joshua have rendered many different spellings. This has brought about mass
confusion to the Name. If the Hebrew spelling of Joshua’s and the Savior’s Name were spelled the same way, and we
have different spellings of that name: how do we know which name to use? I urge all of you to learn the Scripture in
ZakarYah/Zachariah 6:11-12. This is the only scripture that gives us the exact Name of the coming Mashýacḥ:

YAHŪSHÂ (‫)יהושע‬. YAHUSHÂ would carry the same Name as Yahūshâ/Joshua the High Priest, and not
Yahūshâ/Joshua the son of Nun. If Joshua the son of Nun’s name was changed 10,000 times: it is of no consequence for
the Name of YAHŪSHÂ. In order for YAHŪAH not to lie: YAHŪSHÂ’s Name could not have changed!

*Before we go any further, I would like to address the use of the name *Yahoshua. Ya-HO-shua is a word that has been
invented by combining Yashua and ‘hovah’. Remember, ‘hovah’ (H-1943) means mischief/ruin and shua (H-7769) means
to cry out. Yahoshua (the eternal ho cries) not only falls short of being the Name: it is demonic and evil.
                                                                                                           Page 67 of 396

Strong’s H-3091 lists Yahushua as one of the many spellings of Joshua the son of Nun. Let’s look at the history of Joshua.
Joshua in Hebrew was originally Hūshâ/Hosea ‫הושע‬. Hūsha was changed to Yahūshâ ‫ יהושע‬by Mashah/Moses
(B-mdbar/Numbers 13:16). Later, after Babylonian captivity, the Name Joshua changed to Yeshua/Yashua. When
YAHUAH Himself told His Son’s Name, He used the precaptivity form, YAHŪSHÂ ‫יהושע‬, and not the post- captivity
Yeshua/Yashua ‫( ישוע‬ZakarYah/Zachariah 6:11-12). What are we to make of this fourth spelling of Joshua, Yahushua?
Written as yd ha uu shan uu ayn ‫יהושוע‬, Yahushua is one of the primary names used for the Savior by many ‘Hebrew’
followers. Yahushua does carry the first three letters of YAHŪAH with yd ha uu ‫( יהו‬Yahu). If we don’t learn how to
read the Scriptures in context, we will continue to be in a stage of confusion. For the record: Joshua’s name was never
Yahushua! Yahushua was a poetic element (as you will discover) that had to do with crying out or complaining (shua).
Yahushua literally means “Yah of supplications!” Yahushua occurs two times in scripture. In Dabarým/Deuteronomy
3:21, Mashah/Moses called Joshua Yahushua. As Mashah/Moses is speaking all the wonders of YAHŪAH to
Yashar’ål/Israel, he uses Yahushua. Verses 23-25 show how Mashah/Moses was pleading (crying out) to YAHŪAH to
cross over the Yardan/Jordan. He was using the ‘shua’ in his story to explain his sad demeanor: he was denied passage.
As YAHŪAH began to scold Mashah/Moses, in verse 26-27, what did YAHŪAH Himself call Joshua in verse 28?
YAHŪAH firmly re-asserted the masculine form of the name, Yahūshâ ‫יהושע‬, and never referred to Joshua as
Yahushua ‫יהושוע‬. YAHŪAH never used the word ‫ יהושוע‬ANYWHERE in scripture!

The second place we find Yahushua is in Shaphatým/Judges 2:7, which reads, “And the people served YAHŪAH all the
days of Yahūshâ ‫יהושע‬, and all the days of the elders who outlived Yahushua ‫יהושוע‬, who had seen all the great
works of YAHŪAH.” What a confusing verse! Yahūshâ and Yahushua are side by side in this verse; but how can this be?
In verse 4, the messenger of YAHŪAH has given Yashar’ål/Israel some very bad news: the people began to weep. In
verse 6, Joshua is once again referred to as Yahūsha. In verse 8, Yahūsha ben Nūn (Joshua son of Nun) died. When
Yahushua was used in verse 7, we have to read it in context. “And the people served YAHUAH all the days of Yahūshâ
(Joshua son of Nun) and the elders that outlived Yahushua,” Joshua had died and people were sad and crying. This verse
is yet again referring to crying out, and not the Name of the Mashýacḥ. Yahushua was used for Joshua son of Nun’s name
in two instances: both dealing with crying and/or pleading. Yahushua has absolutely no reference in the Scriptures to the
Mashýacḥ.

possible root to the H3068 for ‫יהוה‬. The “Gesenius” entry for this root ‫ הוה‬gives this information:

It is also imperative, that the student studying these roots keep in mind that all these lexicon authors are anchored to the
vowel point system throughout each definition of every entry recorded in their publication. It seems that the H1933 is the
more favorable root for “hu-ah” in Ya-hūah. It is definitely worth considering that the BDB lexicon is in error here.

Section 2: Chap 6              Yahusha: The Name of The Branch




“The scriptures foretold of a Branch of hwhy (Yahūah) that would spring forth and do amazing works. Many have said
this branch is David. Some say it was the church. Some say it was Joshua. The scriptures are very clear in regards to the
Branch…. [fwhy(Yahūshâ)”

                   Who has ascended up into heaven, or descended? Who has gathered the wind in His fists? Who has
bound the waters in a garment? Who has established all the ends of the earth? What is His Name, and what is His Son’s
Name, if you know it?

This section will help explain evidence that clearly foretells The Name of The Savior found in ZakarYah/Zech 6:11-12. In
  the notes on the following page, the Paleo script is used for The Fathers Name hwhy, and Name of The Son [fwhy.
 These are notes for the advanced student of the Hebrew text. If you don’t know how to identify the Paleo Hebrew script
words, don’t panic! Hebrew reference numbers are labeled with each word to help you along. With careful study, and use

‫יהושע‬/Yahūshâ: The foretelling of Mashýacḥ
Hwhyforetold what His Son’s Name would be. ZakarYah/Zechariah 6:11-12 reads, “And you shall take the silver and
gold, and make a crown, and set it upon the head of Yahūshâ, the son of *Yahūtzdak (Yahūtzdak means hwhyis Righteous)
the high Kahan (priest). And speak to him, saying, Thus speaketh hwhy tsabʿåŭṭh, saying, Behold the man whose Name
is The BRANCH! From His place, He shall branch out and build the Hýkal (Temple) of hwhy.” As we can see in this
chapter, ‫( יהושע‬remember: this is the original spelling from the Interlinear Hebrew text) was the High Kahan (priest) who
would build the Hýkal of hwhy. This scripture indeed speaks of Mashýacḥ, and even gives His Name as the Branch: yd ha
uu shan ayn ‫יהושע‬. The High Kahan in ZakarYah/Zechariah foreshadowed the coming Mashýacḥ, and bore the same
exact Name. What was the High Kahan’s Name? ‫יהושע‬/Yahūshâ!

*Yahūtzdak (See pp. 30, 76, 305, 370)

                         We can now do a letter for letter transliteration of the Son’s Name according to the way it was
                         written: ‫יהושע‬. We know that the first three letters of Mashýacḥ’s Name will be pronounced as
                         YAHŪ because of the yd ha uu ‫יהו‬. As you can see, the Father’s Name is already evident in the
Son. The fourth letter is the shan ‫ ש‬which gives us the “sh” sound. Now we have YAHŪSH (Ya-hoosh). The final
Hebrew letter is the ayn ‫ע‬. The ayn ‫ ע‬is pronounced as the letter ‘a’ in Yah. So this gives us YA-HŪ-SHA (Ya-hoo-
shah`). Yd ha uu shan ayn ‫ יהושע‬is the only way the Saviors Name is spelled. Some translations have rendered the High
Kahan as Joshua or Yahushua. It is important to note that Joshua is not a true name, but a name implemented by those
who wish to conceal the truth of hwhyby changing names and meanings. In Dabarým/Deuteronomy 32:44 and
B’madbar/Numbers 13:8, we can read of the original name of Joshua the son of Nūn: Hoshea or Hosea (‫הושע‬, the same
as the Naby`a Hosea). Hoshea has a Hebrew spelling of ha uu shan ayn ‫ הושע‬and is pronounced Hu-sha (hoo-shah).
Hūsha (Hosea) is found 11 times in the Hebrew text, and means Savior or Deliverer. In verse 16 of B’madbar/Numbers
chapter 13, Mashah/Moses changed the name of Hūsha (original name of Joshua) to Yahushâ (new name of Joshua).
Mashah/Moses added the Hebrew letter yd ‫ י‬to ha uu shan ayn ‫( הושע‬Hūsha) and called the new name yd ha uu shan
ayn ‫( יהושע‬Yahūshâ), which is to say, “Yah is Deliverer/Savior!”

Given the various Hebrew spellings of the original name of Joshua, and the fact that there were four men that bore the
same name as the coming Mashýacḥ: we must remember that the prophesy was concerning the Yahūshâ (Joshua) in
ZakarYah/Zachariah 6. Hwhysaid the Mashýacḥ would have the same name as Yahūshâ the son of Yahūtzdak, not
Yahūshâ the son of Nūn (whose name was later shortened to Yeshua/Joshua). Yahūshâ the Kahan, son of Yahūtzdak
(hwhyis Righteous), was crowned and named the Branch who would build the Hýkal (Temple). YAHŪSHÂ is the Name
of Ha Mashýacḥ!

Section 2: Chap 7                            The Name Revealed
                                                Cepher Publishing Group

The Name is being revealed among the Christian communities through the "‫ את‬Cepher”, most recently published in 2014.
 The "‫ את‬Cepher”, second edition; is a Bible translation that now transliterates the Father’s Name, and The Name of His
Son into the English as; “YAHUAH” and “YAHUSHA HAMACHIACH”. During the fifth year of writing “Evidence for
   The Name”, this new Bible translation was brought to my attention. The following paragraphs briefly explain how
  Stephen Pidgeon, founder of Cepher Publishing Group, came to discover that The Name of The Most High has been
                                             hidden with replacement titles.

“Stephen began to read not only the books designated as the Apocrypha, but also other books such as those found in the
Dead Sea Scrolls. Early in 2002, he began to compile his own “Bible” for personal use, which also included the Book of
Jubilees and the Book of Enoch. In 2006, Stephen and one of his Bible Study partners, Brad Huckins, were sharing
information about various editions of the Bible and discussing the accuracy of these translations when they discovered a
similar interest in uncovering the essential truth of the scriptures. Late in 2008, Stephen first suggested that the public
domain copy of the King James Bible should be modified to minimize the archaic English. This resulted in the first digital
file serving as a baseline for the scriptures in the book we now call the ‫ את‬CEPHER.

There were notorious errors in the KJV, and we began to unravel some of these. First, we compared the KJV with the
Tyndale Bible which preceded it, allowing us to compare and correct some of the conclusions made by the KJV editors.
However, we corrected the New Testament by using the Stephanus Textus Receptus and comparing each term using
Strong’s Greek Concordance and other Greek Lexicons, including several Greek Online Dictionaries and the Septuagint.
Initially, we used the Hebrew Masoretic text for purposes of cyphering the underlying Hebrew, the Strong’s Hebrew
Concordance and other Hebrew Lexicons; however, in the final analysis, we have made reference to over five databases
for the Hebrew text (excluding the Dead Sea Scrolls). In addition, we have made comparisons across other English texts
(most of which having glaring errors and omissions), and relied upon other Textus Receptus editions, the Latin Vulgate,
the Codex Vaticanus, the Shem Tov Hebrew Gospel of Matthew, as well as other source material using state-of-the-art
software systems for reference.

   As you might imagine, we were simply stunned at what we found. First, the most important names in the Bible had not
been translated, or even transliterated. Instead, the names were substituted! We found this alarming, particularly in light of
 scriptural references being expressed about publishing and declaring the name. This is when we elected to add the sacred
   name to the text, which was no easy task. We were misled by the Masoretic text and had to reach our own conclusion;
however, after testing the sacred name in Israel over a period of two years, we came to conclude that the name is properly
  pronounced YAHUAH. Once we reached this conclusion, we decided to correctly transliterate all of the other names in
  the text. This resulted in 3800 name changes! Again, we were stunned at what we learned because all of the names have
              particular meaning; which reveals so much more!” Online Source: (http://www.cepher.net/about.aspx)



I find it interesting that this team of investigators confessed that they were “misled” by the Masoretic text. In this project,
we have been learning that aside from replacement titles, vowel points surrounding The Name of ‫יהוה‬, has corrupted The
Name in the Masoretic text. This includes other Hebrew names as well. Still, it is quite clear, that this publishing team,
continues to use the vowel points in this translation of the "‫ את‬Cepher”. Nevertheless, The Name of Yahūah and
Yahūshâ, has finally broken free of them. On the following page, I have inserted a few screen captures of the preface
within the "‫ את‬Cepher”. These screen captures will give you a glimpse of why the “Cepher Publishing Group” decided to
use The Name of Yahūah and Yahūshâ, in this new translation of the scriptures. Make no mistake, this publication of the
scriptures is unprecedented.

                This is a preview of the first 3 verses of the book of Revelation within the ‫ את‬Cepher.




This is the first ‘Bible’ translation in print, ever, that carries the correct English transliteration of “Yahūshâ” for The
                       Saviors Name. The Salvation of Yahūah is being revealed in these last days.

Section 2: Chap 8                     AHYAH: Name or Accolade?




                                                        Did you notice that the writer of this Preface claims that Yahūah
                                                        “gives his name as” in Shamūṭh/Ex 3:14? Well, did He? Many
                                                        actually believe that The Most High revealed His Name in
                                                        Shamūṭh/Ex 3:14 as Åhýah/‫אהיה‬. This teaching is widespread. This
                                                        claim needs to be proven. The “Wikipedia” insert found in the
                                                        Introduction of this book states, “Scholars widely propose that the name
                                                        YHWH is a verb form derived from the Biblical Hebrew triconsonantal root
                                                        ‫( היה‬h-y-h) “to be”, which has ‫( הוה‬h-w-h) as a variant form, with a third
                                                        person masculine y- prefix. It is connected to the passage in Exodus 3:14 in
                                                        which God gives his name as ‫( אֶ ְהיֶה אֲ ֶשׁר אֶ ְהיֶה‬Ehyeh Asher Ehyeh),
                                                        translated most basically as “I am that I am” (or “I Will Be What I Will Be”,
                                                        “I Will Be What I Am”).

                                                        There it is ladies! We have a match. I cannot begin to tell you how
                                                        many research documents I have searched out, that agree with this
                                                        view. I don’t think it would be necessary to include quotes from other
                                                        writers or scholars on this subject. It would just take up more space in
                                                        the book. Instead, if any of you students are interested in searching
                                                        out how far back this view goes, Google search: “Theological word
                                                        study on Tetragrammaton”. A plethora of information will come up
                                                        and you will be reading documents from here to eternity. This claim
                                                        goes back a long way. So, without getting caught up in all the hoopla,
                                                        let’s just keep it simple, shall we?

Verse 15 reveals His Name. Verse 14 does not. Pardon me, for being so blunt. Now, I believe, that what was said in verse
14, is a characteristic or accolade of His Name; a description of His power or being to self-exist. His Name is given in vs.
15 with the H3068 assigned to it. Åhýah in vs. 14, has the H1961 assigned to it (See p. 73). One is a name, and the other is
not. One was spoken as a name, and the other was not. But, what I believe is of no consequence to what is actually in the
original script. My opinion proves nothing. So, how can I prove what I believe? If someone asks me about this issue, how
can I answer their question accurately, with witnesses, in the Hebrew text? Well, you have to look at what He said, not
what you assume He said, based on published literature you have been fed with over the years. Remember the “Make the
lie big, make it simple, keep saying it, and eventually they will believe it” quote by Adolf Hitler? We have all fallen prey
to this trick. Nobody has escaped it. So, let’s look at the first portion of the Hebrew text in verse 15. Remember, to read
the Hebrew backwards. Ehyeh Asher Ehyeh/‫ אֶ ְהיֶה אֲ ֶשׁר אֶ ְהיֶה‬- this should read like this: Åhýah ashar Åhýah/‫אהיה אשר אהיה‬


                  ‫ויאמר עוד אלהים אל־משה כה־תאמר אל־בני‬
                   sons    to       speak     thus         Mashah       to         Ålahým     moreover     And said


                                            Now, the second portion of the text.
                                                     (Ålahý is a form of Ålahým)

                          ‫ישראל יהוה אלהי אבתיכם אלהי אברהם אלהי‬
                          Ålahý   Åbraham       Ålahý        your fathers     Ålahý    Yahūah     Yasharʿål
                                                                                                                  Page 83 of 396


                                             Here, is the third portion of the text.


                ‫יצחק ואלהי יעקב שלחני אליכם זה־שמי לעלם וזה‬
                And this forever   my name - this       to you       has sent me    Yʿâqb   And Ålahý Yatscḥaq


                                             Here, is the fourth portion of the text.


                                                      ‫זכרי לדר דר׃‬
                                                    generations to all   my remembrance

Just observing the highlighted text alone, can solve this riddle. But if someone wanted to get nasty about it, there are
plenty of options for digging up witnesses on this issue, besides the obvious on this page. Without going any further, it is
clear that a name is used in the text. One might argue, vs. 14 lists Åhýah as a name too. For the sake of argument, let’s
disregard the knowledge that Åhýah is a verb form altogether. Let’s also disregard Yahūah as a noun, or definite article, in
vs. 15. With the tools we have been given to work with, how can we reach beyond persuasive evidence? What steps can
we take, that will help us attain conclusive evidence: that which renders the argument to completion; leaving thoughts of
doubt as miniscule, to virtually nonexistent. Even though we can see that a name is clear in vs. 15, we can take this
investigation further; beyond the English, and beyond one word. Now, let me tell you the steps I took to prove out this
particular controversy to myself. I will show you how I attained conclusive evidence in the Åhýah –Yahūah controversy. I
simply cannot be moved in my beliefs on this matter, and this is the reason why.

Step one: I went into The Word software on my computer and typed in this four letter Hebrew word: ‫אהיה‬
Before I go any further, I want to give a quick introduction to The Word software for new students. This software is a
must have for studying the scriptures. It’s easy to use, relatively easy to learn navigation, and best of all, it is free. You
can download it from “www.theword.net”. Back to step one.

                I have highlighted the words where Åhýah, for H1961, is located in the English and Hebrew.
                                 “The Blue Letter Bible” only shows 32 passages for Åhýah.

B rʿåshýṭh/Gen 26:3 “Sojourn in this land. And I shall be with you and favor you, for I give all these lands to you and your seed. And I
shall establish the oath which I swore to Åbraham your father.”
          ‫גור בארץ הזאת ואהיה עמך ואברכך כי־לך ולזרעך אתן את־כל־הארצת האל והקמתי את־השבעה אשר נשבעתי לאברהם אביך׃‬

B rʿåshýṭh/Gen 31:3 And Yahūah/‫ יהוה‬said to Yʿâqb, “Return to the land of your fathers and to your relatives. And I am with you.”
                                      ‫ויאמר יהוה אל־יעקב שוב אל־ארץ אבותיך ולמולדתך ואהיה עמך׃‬


Shamūṭh/Ex 3:12 And He said, “Because I am with you. And this is to you the sign that I have sent you: When you have brought the
people out of Matsarým, you are to serve Ålahým on this mountain.”
                ‫ויאמר כי־אהיה עמך וזה־לך האות כי אנכי שלחתיך בהוציאך את־העם ממצרים תעבדון את־האלהים על ההר הזה׃‬

Shamūṭh/Ex 3:14 And Ålahým said to Mashah, “I am that which I am.” And He said, “Thus you shall say to the children of Yasharʿål,
‘I am has sent me to you.’ ”
                          ‫ויאמר אלהים אל־משה אהיה אשר אהיה ויאמר כה תאמר לבני ישראל אהיה שלחני אליכם׃‬

Shamūṭh/Ex 4:12 “And now, go, and I shall be with your mouth and teach you what to say.”

Shamūṭh/Ex 4:15 “And you shall speak to him and put the words in his mouth. And I am with your mouth and with his mouth, and I
shall teach you what to do.

Dabarým/Deut 31:23 And He commanded Yahūshâ son of Nūn, and said, “Be strong and courageous, for you are to bring the children
of Yasharʿål into the land of which I swore to them, and I Myself am with you.”

Yahūshâ/Josh 1:5 “No man is going to stand before you all the days of your life. As I was with Mashah, so I am with you. I do not fail
you nor forsake you.

Yahūshâ/Josh 3:7 And Yahūah/‫ יהוה‬said to Yahūshâ, “This day I begin to make you great before the eyes of all Yasharʿål, so that
they know that I am with you as I was with Mashah.

Shamūʿål Ålaph/1Sam 18:18 And Dūd said to Shʿåŭl, “Who am I, and what is my life or my father’s clan in Yasharʿål, that I am son-
in-law to the sovereign?”
                                 ‫ויאמר דוד אל־שאול מי אנכי ומי חיי משפחת אבי בישראל כי־אהיה חתן למלך׃‬

reign over Yasharʿål, and I am to be next to you. Even my father Shʿåŭl knows that.”

Shamūʿål Býṭh/2Sam 7:6 “For I have not dwelt in a house since the time that I brought the children of Yasharʿål up from Matsarým,
even to this day, and I am moving about in a Tent and in a Dwelling Place.

Shamūʿål Býṭh/2Sam 7:9 “And I am with you wherever you walk, and cut off all your enemies from before you, and made you a great
name, like the name of the great ones who are on the earth.

Shamūʿål Býṭh/2Sam 7:14 “I am to be his Father, and he is My son. If he does perversely, I shall reprove him with the rod of men and
with the blows of the sons of men.
                             ‫אני אהיה־לו לאב והוא יהיה־לי לבן אשר בהעותו והכחתיו בשבט אנשים ובנגעי בני אדם׃‬

Shamūʿål Býṭh/2Sam 15:34 but if you return to the city, and say to Åbshalūm, ‘I am your servant, O sovereign – once servant of your
father, but now I am your servant,’ then you shall nullify the counsel of Åcḥýthaphal for me.
           ‫ואם־העיר תשוב ואמרת לאבשלום עבדך אני המלך אהיה עבד אביך ואני מאז ועתה ואני עבדך והפרתה לי את עצת אחיתפל׃‬

Shamūʿål Býṭh/2Sam 16:18 And Cḥūshý said to Åbshalūm, “No, I am for the one whom Yahūah/‫ יהוה‬and this people and all the men
of Yasharʿål have chosen, and with him I remain.
                         ‫ויאמר חושי אל־אבשלם לא כי אשר בחר יהוה והעם הזה וכל־איש ישראל לא אהיה ואתו אשב׃‬

This is such an interesting study. Already I can see how this word is used: “I am,” “I shall be,” “I will become.” It’s like,
the description of His Name is foretelling His character of existence. “I exist to be your Ålahým.” Gnaw on that for
awhile. In addition to this, 10 of these passages that use the verb Åhýah/‫אהיה‬, also use The Hebrew Name Yahūah/‫יהוה‬
within the same passage. I want to reiterate why I would ever do such a study: to prove or clarify, whether or not the verb
Åhýah is a name, or a characteristic of a name; and to find witnesses in the Hebrew text to support my findings.

Now, put all this aside for a minute. Everything I just did in my software program, may be to some students, a bit overkill.
But, it was worth the effort. I learned some things. I also learned that I don’t know much. This makes me hungry to learn
more. I can however, be for certain that I missed something in this study. As long as I am alive, I can always go back into
my notes and dig up more information. I understand why some of you would think this might be overkill. Because
Shamūṭh/Ex 3:15 clearly reveals His Name, and clarified it with this phrase, “This is My Name” / ‫זה־שמי‬. Sometimes, it
takes a whole lot more than the obvious to use as witnesses to unravel a false implication. Just because the English
translation says something that seems to support our argument, we still need to prove it by the Hebrew text.

Step 2:
Now, leaving the best part of this study for last, I know that name in Hebrew is Shm/‫שם‬. If I was to see in the Hebrew,
the word ‫( שמו‬shmū), I know it would say; His Name. ‫( שמי‬shmý) is; my name. ‫( שמך‬shmak) is; your name. These are
conjugated forms of the word Shm/‫שם‬. Adding an additional character to this word changes the possession: my name, his
name, your name. Did you notice the last letter in ‫ ?שם‬It doesn’t seem to be found in any of the conjugated forms does
it? The mým has two forms: ‫מ‬-‫ם‬. Make sure you know the difference between these two forms. Otherwise, you will be
typing in the wrong word for your word searches. One form is called the final mým and is only found at the end of a word
in Hebrew (See Hebrew chart on p. 10). If you don’t do your homework, this can cause a serious amount of wasted effort,
not to mention a serious headache. It is an easy mistake to make, so don’t be too hard on yourself if it happens too often.

So far, I have searched out Åhýah/‫ אהיה‬in the Hebrew and found 51 passages that consistently support my claim that it is:
an accolade or characteristic. This characteristic or verb is used as: to be; I am (with you); I will be (with you); I shall be
(your Ålahým); I will become (your Ålahým). That is plenty of witnesses for that portion of the study. But, what if one
was to have no knowledge of the word ‫ ?שם‬How does a first time student prove the English translation portion of this
passage that says, “This is My Name” without knowing how to read Hebrew? The Ålaph Býṭh chart is your first step.
Learn those letters. Your second step, is to look into the English translation that includes “Strong’s” reference numbers. A
“Hebrew and English Interlinear Bible” would be ideal. Downloading “The Word” software into your computer would be
even better. Whatever you choose, the “Strong’s” numbers will give access to Hebrew words that you can isolate for
study. Look these words up, learn them, so you will know them.

The H8034 is assigned to ‫שם‬. “Brown-Driver-Briggs” gives it this definition: name; memorial; monument; reputation. To
dig up conjugated forms of ‫שם‬, type in English, “my name”, “his name”, “your name”. Then, change your English
translation passage, to a Hebrew text such as the “Hisb” (Hebrew Interpolated Study Bible) or “WLC” (Westminster
Leningrad Codex). Shamūṭh/Ex 3:15 shown in the “Hisb” would look like this:

The helpful thing about using this Study Bible is that the conjugated counterpart is separated from the word by a dot.
What a wonderful tool to have for the new student when on the hunt for conjugated words. Notice the highlighted word?
Zkr/‫ זכר‬is the H2143: Rememberance. Add the Yd/‫י‬, and it says, “my remembrance”. This handy tool tells you what the

You can do this with the word “Ålahým” as well. You can do this with any word to find its conjugated counterpart. The
more understanding you have about how conjugated words work in the Hebrew language, the more helpful this will be in
your understanding of how the Hebrew language puts words and phrases together. ‫( השם‬hashm) is the conjugated form of
‫ שם‬which means “the name”. ‫( בשם‬bshm) is the conjugated form of ‫ שם‬which is translated, “in the name”.

Now, I need to find scripture witnesses for this conjugated word, Shmý/‫שמי‬. I am looking for consistant usage of the
Hebrew word, ‫ שמי‬translated: “my name”, with Yahūah/‫ יהוה‬speaking in the passage. Here is what I found.


    YaramYahū/Jer 16:21 “Therefore see, I am causing them to know. This time I cause them to know Åṭh/‫ את‬My Hand and Åṭh/‫את‬
    My Might. And they shall know that Shamý/‫( שמי‬My Name) is Yahūah/‫”!יהוה‬


              ‫לכן הנני מודיעם בפעם הזאת אודיעם את־ידי ואת־גבורתי וידעו כי ־ שמי יהוה׃ ס‬

                             More of these witnesses are found on p. 111. No need to list them here.


             As I review these notes, I can look at both passages in the English, then view them in the Hebrew.

Shamūṭh/Exod 3:14 And Ålahým said to Mashah, “I am that which I am.” And He said, “Thus you shall say to the children of
Yasharʿål, ‘I am has sent me to you.’ ” (He never said this was His Name. His Name was given in the next passage.)

               ‫ויאמר אלהים אל־משה אהיה אשר אהיה ויאמר כה תאמר לבני ישראל אהיה שלחני אליכם׃‬

Shamūṭh/Exod 3:15 And Ålahým said further to Mashah, “Thus you are to say to the children of Yasharʿål, ‘Yahūah/‫ יהוה‬Ålahým of
your fathers, the Ålahým of Åbraham, the Ålahým of Yatscḥaq, and the Ålahým of Yʿâqb, has sent me to you. This is Shmý/‫( שמי‬My
Name) forever, and this is My remembrance to all generations.’(“This is My Name” means He revealed His Name in vs. 15.)


   ‫ויאמר עוד אלהים אל־משה כה־תאמר אל־בני ישראל יהוה אלהי אבתיכם אלהי אברהם‬
       ‫אלהי יצחק ואלהי יעקב שלחני אליכם זה ־ שמי לעלם וזה זכרי לדר דר׃‬
                            my       this and         (is)my name – this
                         remembrance

H1961- ‫ היה‬to be, become, come to pass, exist, happen, fall out (incorrect root for H3068; See p. 73)
H3068- ‫ יהוה‬the proper name of the one true God/Ålahým
      a. unpronounced except with the vowel pointing of 0136 (Adonai)
Both definitions taken from “Brown-Driver-Briggs” Hebrew definitions in “The Word” software.
(Notice the ‫ ו‬is used frequently in Hebrew for the word and.)
I am almost finished with this study on Åhýah/‫אהיה‬. Do you remember how I typed in my search word in “The Word”
software at the beginning of this study? I typed in the four letter spelling (‫ )אהיה‬as it is found in the 14th vs. of
Shamūṭh/Ex chapter 3. Now, I will do a search by typing in the three letter spelling without the ålaph (‫)היה‬.
                                                                                                                      Page 90 of 396

This word is found 1,423 times in the WLC. How can I be sure how this 3 letter word (‫)היה‬, with the Hebrew reference
number H1961, is used contextually if I don’t look into all these passages? I can’t. It is impossible without completing the
study all the way through. However, at this point, I am pretty comfortable with what I have. The information in verse 15 is
mighty convincing. Still, I think it would be wise to check out what the rest of those passages are hiding. Here are the
results. Step 3.
                                                 -Hyah Study Notes-

‫ היה‬used in these ways:
‫ נהיה‬translated - will become
‫ יהיה‬translated - shall be, yet become/yet to become, is, are, be, (have/own Ex 13:12; 18:16)
‫ והיה‬translated - and became, and was, and shall be, will become, come to pass, came to be
‫ שהיה‬translated – to being (this form is found in Qhalaṭh/Ecc and Ṭahalým/Ps.)
‫ היה‬translated - was, become, became, came to be, came/had come, had, had been, has been, been, (did from Shamūʿål
Ålaph/1Sam 2:11 - ‫ והנער היה משרת את־יהוה‬- translated “and the boy did minister before Yahūah-Åṭh.”
‫ תהיה‬translated - It is, have, made, come into being, you shall be, shall belong, come to, (when the ‫ ת‬is used, the
translation seems to be consistent with the possession of “unto you” or “ to become yours” shall be to you”) Example:
 ‫ קדש תהיה לך ליהוה׃‬- translated in Shamūṭh/Ex 30:37 “ it is Set-Apart unto you for Yahūah.” Other passages use this form
as “it shall be”. Example: ‫ – סלת בלולה בשמן מצה תהיה׃‬translated in Ū Yaqrå/Lev 2:5, “it shall be of fine flour, unleavened,
mixed with oil."

                                                        Side by side.

Shamūʿål Ålaph/1Sam 20:42 And Yahūnaṭhan said to Dūd, “Go in peace, since we have both sworn in the Name of Yahūah/‫יהוה‬,
saying, ‘Yahūah/‫ יהוה‬is between you and me, and between your seed and my seed, forever.’ ” Then he arose and left, and
Yahūnaṭhan went into the city.

‫ויאמר יהונתן לדוד לך לשלום אשר נשבענו שנינו אנחנו בשם יהוה לאמר יהוה יהיה ביני ובינך ובין זרעי ובין זרעך‬
                                    ‫עד־עולם׃ פ ויקם וילך ויהונתן בא העיר׃‬
                                This passage can be translated, “Yahūah exists between you and me...”

Shamūʿål Ålaph/1Sam 24:15 “And Yahūah/‫ יהוה‬shall be judge; and rightly rule between you and me. See and plead my case, and
rightly rule me out of your hand.”

                           ‫והיה יהוה לדין ושפט ביני ובינך וירא וירב את־ריבי וישפטני מידך׃ פ‬
                           This passage can be translated, “Yahūah shall exist as judge; and rightly rule...”



3.                                     THE WORD OF YAHUAH CAME! ‫יהוה‬                      ‫היה‬
Shamūʿål Býṭh/2Sam 24:11 And Dūd rose up in the morning, and The Word of Yahūah/‫ יהוה‬came to the nabýå Gad, Dūd seer, saying,
                               ‫ויקם דוד בבקר פ ודבר־יהוה היה אל־גד הנביא חזה דוד לאמר‬
            The red portion of this passage can also be translated, “and The Word of Yahūah arose” or arose to exist/to be.
                                                                                                                    Page 91 of 396

                                                     This is getting really cool!

                                                   YAHUAH WAS! ‫היה‬           ‫יהוה‬
4.
Malakým Ålaph/1Kgs 1:37 “As Yahūah/‫ יהוה‬was with my master the sovereign, so let Him be with Shalamah and make his throne
greater than the throne of my master Sovereign Dūd.”

                       ‫כאשר היה יהוה עם־אדני המלך כן יהי עם־שלמה ויגדל את־כסאו מכסא אדני המלך דוד׃‬
                          This passage can be translated, “Yahūah existed with my master the sovereign...”

                                                MY NAME EXISTS! ‫יהיה־שמי‬
5.
Malakým Ålaph/1Kgs 8:29 “For Your eyes to be open toward this House night and day, toward the place of which You said, ‘My
Name is there,’ to listen to the prayer which Your servant makes toward this place.

     ‫להיות עינך פתחות אל־הבית הזה לילה ויום אל־המקום אשר אמרת יהיה שמי שם לשמע אל־התפלה אשר יתפלל עבדך אל־המקום‬
                                                      ‫הזה׃‬
                                      This passage can be translated, “My Name exists there...”

                                                MY NAME EXISTS! ‫יהיה־שמי‬
6.
Dabarý Ha Yamým Býṭh/2Chr 33:4 And he built Slaughter Places in the House of Yahūah/‫יהוה‬, of which Yahūah/‫ יהוה‬had said, “In
Yarūshalam is My Name, forever.”
                                 ‫ובנה מזבחות בבית יהוה אשר אמר יהוה בירושלם יהיה־שמי לעולם׃‬
                             This passage can be translated, “In Yarūshalam, My Name exists forever...”

       This study is ringing some bells. What I am seeing, is reminding me of some passages that I can’t seem to shake.

Cḥazūn/Rev 1:8 “I am the ‘Ålaph’ and the ‘Ṭū’, Beginning and End,” says Yahūah/‫“ יהוה‬who is and who was and who is to come,
the Almighty.”

YashâYahū/Isa 41:4 “Who has performed and done it, calling the generations from the beginning? ‘I, Yahūah/‫יהוה‬, the first, and with
the last I am He.’ ”
                               ‫מי־פעל ועשה קרא הדרות מראש אני יהוה ראשון ואת־אחרנים אני־הוא׃‬

Now, that I have thoroughly searched out all 51 passages for Åhýah/‫אהיה‬, and all 1,423 passages for Hýah/‫היה‬, I have
come to a reasonable conclusion from my findings. I believe this is sufficient and conclusive evidence, to support my
claim that was stated from the beginning of the study. Step one revealed: Åhýah is used as a characteristic; a description;
accolade; to be, to exist. Step two revealed: looking at conjugated forms of the word Shm/‫שם‬, confirms what is written in
the Hebrew text in vs. 15 when He said, “This is My Name”/‫זה שמי‬. Step 3 revealed: The Name of Yahūah and Hýah or
Åhýah, can sit side by side within the same passage; and affects past, present, and future tense; within the context of the
passage. Out of a total of 1,474 passages, not one passage revealed Hýah or Åhýah to be exclusivley related to:

         ‘My Name Åhýah’, which would look like this in Hebrew: ‫ שמי אהיה‬no passage found
         ‘This is My Name Åhýah’, which would look like this in Hebrew: ‫ זה שמי אהיה‬no passage found
         ‘I am Åhýah. That is My Name’, which would look like this in Hebrew: ‫ אני אהיה הוא שמי‬no passage found
         ‘In The Name Åhýah’, which would look like this in Hebrew: ‫ בשם אהיה‬no passage found
         ‘The Name Åhýah’, which would look like this in Hebrew: ‫ השמ אהיה‬no passage found
         Åný/‫ אני‬Åhýah’ meaning, ‘I am Åhýah/‫ ’אהיה‬no passage found (It would look like this in the Hebrew: ‫)אני אהיה‬
         Åný/‫ אני‬Hýah meaning, ‘I am Hýah/‫ היה‬no passage found (It would look like this in the Hebrew: ‫)אני היה‬
                                                                                                          Page 92 of 396

    There are however, plenty of passages revealing:

             ‘My Name Yahūah’ in Hebrew: ‫ שמי יהוה‬Found: Malʿåký/Mal 1:11 (See p.111)
             ‘This is My Name Yahūah’ in Hebrew: ‫ זה שמי יהוה‬Found: Shamūṭh/Ex 3:15
             ‘I am Yahūah. That is My Name’ in Hebrew: ‫ אני יהוה הוא שמי‬Found: YashâYahū/Isa 42:8 (See p. 96)
             ‘In The Name Yahūah’ in Hebrew: ‫ בשם יהוה‬Found: Shamūṭh/Ex 33:19 (See p. 105)
             ‘The Name Yahūah’ in Hebrew: ‫ השמ יהוה‬Found: Dabarým/Deut 32:3 (See p. 120)
             Åný/‫ אני‬Yahūah’ meaning, ‘I am Yahūah: ‫ אני יהוה‬Found: Shamūṭh/Ex 10:2 (See p. 96)

The Most High did not give His Name in Shamūṭh/Ex 3:14. He just simply said, “to be” or who was, is and is to come, all
wrapped up into one word: Åhýah. This statement He made, reveals some unexpected treasures, about His character. His
character is attached to a Name. He claims to be The One who Was, Is and The One to Become; to Come; to Arrive; to
Come on the scene. No matter how you slice it, Åhýah is not a name. This verb describes what His Name was, is and will
Become to us; because The Name of Yahūah is full of salvation and deliverance! This Name Yahūah, is the only place
you can find life, salvation, cover, knowledge, healing, peace, righteousness, favor, mercy, love, greatness which is the
seat of humility according to The Word of Yahūah. Perfection; which is the fullness of maturity in your walk with
Yahūshâ; who is The Word of Yahūah; Safety from His wrath; which doesn’t even scratch the surface. Now that sounds
like A Name above every name!

This "‫ את‬Cepher” translation of the scriptures, revealing The Name of Yahūah and Yahūshâ in the English translation,
reminds me of some foretelling’s about His Name in the end days. Here are a few of those passages of scripture referring
to ‫יהוה‬, and how His Name will be great among the Gentiles. The following passage gives more than enough evidence to
support my claim for Shamŭṭh/Ex 3:15.

(NET)
Malʿåký/Mal 1:11 For from the east to the west My Name will be great among the nations. Incense and pure offerings
will be offered in My Name everywhere, for My Name will be great among the nations,” says Yahūah/‫ יהוה‬Tsabʿåŭṭh.

  ‫כי ממזרח־שמש ועד־מבואו גדול שמי בגוים ובכל־מקום מקטר מגש לשמי ומנחה טהורה כי־גדול שמי בגוים אמר‬
                                            ‫יהוה צבאות׃‬

Yacḥazaqʿål/Ezek 36:23 I will magnify My Great Name that has been profaned among the nations that you have profaned
among them. The nations will know that I am Yahūah/‫יהוה‬, declares Ådaný Yahūah/‫יהוה אדני‬, when I Magnify Myself
among you in their sight.

Dabarým/Deut 30:1-3 “And it shall be, when all These Words come upon you, The Barakah and The Curse which I have
set before you, and you shall bring them back to your heart among all the gentiles where Yahūah/‫ יהוה‬your Ålahým drives
you, 2and shall turn back to Yahūah/‫ יהוה‬your Ålahým and obey His Voice, according to all that I Command you today,
with all your heart and with all your being, you and your children, 3then Yahūah/‫ יהוה‬your Ålahým shall turn back your
captivity, and your compassion, and He shall turn back and gather you from all the peoples where Yahūah/‫ יהוה‬your
Ålahým has scattered you.

  Tell me something. Where is “Åhýah, your Ålahým” in the Hebrew text? It would look like this in the Hebrew below:

                                    *‫ – אהיה אלהיך‬translated as: Åhýah, your Ålahým
        I challenge anyone to find this in any Hebrew/Aramaic script. Also, When is Åhýah/‫ אהיה‬not used as a verb?
*‫( אלהיך‬See p. 132)

                 Characteristics in English and in Hebrew, are in red. The Name of Yahūah in Hebrew, is in blue.

B rʿåshýṭh/Gen 2:4 These are the births of the heavens and the earth when they were created, in the day that
Yahūah/‫ יהוה‬Ålahým (mighty ones; see B rʿåshýṭh/Gen 1:26) made earth and heavens. (‫)יהוה אלהים‬
B rʿåshýṭh/Gen 21:33 And he planted a tamarisk tree in Bʿår Shabâ, and there called on the Name of Yahūah/‫יהוה‬,
Everlasting Mighty One (‫)יהוה אל עולם‬.
B rʿåshýṭh/Gen 22:14 And Åbraham called the name of the place, ‘Yahūah/‫ יהוה‬Yråʾah,’ as it is said to this day, “On the
mountain Yahūah/‫ יהוה‬provides.” (‫)יהוה יראה‬
B rʿåshýṭh/Gen 16:13 And she called the Name of Yahūah/‫ יהוה‬who spoke to her, “You are the Ål who sees,” for she
said, “Even here have I seen after Him who sees me?” (‫)יהוה ראי‬
B rʿåshýṭh/Gen 17:1 And it came to be when Åbram was ninety-nine years old, that Yahūah/‫ יהוה‬appeared to Åbram
and said to him, “I am Ål Shdý – walk before Me and be perfect. (‫)יהוה אל שדי‬
Shamūṭh/Ex 15:26 And He said, “If you diligently obey The Voice of Yahūah/‫ יהוה‬your Ålahým and do what is right in
His Eyes, and shall listen to His Commands and shall guard all His Laws, I shall bring on you none of the diseases I
brought on the Matsarým, for I am Yahūah/‫ יהוה‬your Healer.” (‫)אני יהוה רפאך‬
Shamūṭh/Ex 17:15, 16 And Mashah built a Slaughter Place and called its name, Yahūah/‫ יהוה‬is my Nasý (banner). 16For
he said, “Because a hand is on the throne of Yah, Yahūah/‫ יהוה‬is to fight against Âmalq, from generation to
generation.” (‫)יהוה נסי‬
Shamūṭh/Ex 31:13 “And you, speak to the children of Yasharʿål, saying, ‘My Shabaṭhs you are to guard, by all means, for
it is a sign between Me and you throughout your generations, so you may know that it is I am, Yahūah/‫יהוה‬, mqdashcm
(who sets you apart).’” (‫ ) אני יהוה מקדשכם‬Most translations render this verse as, “’...who Sanctifies you.’”
Dabarým/Deut 26:17 “You have today caused Yahūah/‫ יהוה‬Åūṭh to proclaim to be your Ålahým, and to walk in His
Ways and guard His Laws, and His Commands, and His Right-Rulings, and to obey His Voice. (‫)יהוה את‬
Dabarý/Deut 30:20 “…to love Yahūah/‫ יהוה‬your Ålahým, to obey His Voice, and to cling to Him – for He is your Cḥý

Dabarý Ha Yamým Býṭh/2Chr 14:11 Åså qrå/‫( קרא‬cried; summoned) to Yahūah/‫ יהוה‬his Ålahým and said
“Yahūah/‫יהוה‬, there is none besides You to help between the mighty and him that has no strength. Help us

our Ålahým. Let not man prevail against You.”
Dabarý Ha Yamým Býṭh/2Chr 20:9 If evil comes upon us: the sword, judgment, or pestilence, or famine, we will

Ṭahalým/Ps 45:17 I will make Your Name to be remembered in all generations. Therefore, the people shall

   Yahūah/‫ יהוה‬Åṭh/‫ את‬will not leave unpunished who lifts up Åṭh/‫ את‬His Name to ruin.
   Dabarým/Deut 32:3 “For I proclaim Sham/‫( שם‬Name) of Yahūah/‫יהוה‬. Ascribe greatness to our Ålahým.”
   Yahūshâ/Josh 9:9 So they said to him, “From a land very far off your servants have come, because of the Sham/‫שם‬
    (Name) of Yahūah/‫ יהוה‬your Ålahým. For we have heard the report Åṭh/‫ את‬and all that He did in Matsarým.”
   Malakým Ålaph/1Ki 3:2 The people, however, were still slaughtering at the high places, because a House had not yet
   been built for Sham/‫( שם‬Name) of Yahūah/‫יהוה‬.
   Malakým Ålaph/1Ki 5:3 “You know that because of the wars waged against my father Dūd/‫ דוד‬from all sides, he
   could not build a House for Sham/‫( שם‬Name) of Yahūah/‫ יהוה‬his Ålahým, until Yahūah/‫ יהוה‬Åṭh/‫ את‬put his

   relation to Sham/‫( שם‬Name) of Yahūah/‫יהוה‬, she came to test him with hard questions.
   Dabarý Ha Yamým Ålaph/1Chr 22:7 Dūd said to Shalamah, “My son, I had it in my heart to build a House for
   Sham/‫( שם‬Name) of Yahūah/‫ יהוה‬my Ålahým.”
   Dabarý Ha Yamým Ålaph/1Chr 22:19 “Now, devote your heart and being to seek Yahūah/‫ יהוה‬your Ålahým. Begin to

   Dabarý Ha Yamým Býṭh/2Chr 2:1 Shalamah ordered a House be built for Sham/‫( שם‬Name) of Yahūah/‫ יהוה‬and a

   Dabarý Ha Yamým Býṭh/2Chr 6:7 “And it came to be within the heart of Dūýd my father, to build a House for
   Sham/‫( שם‬Name) of Yahūah/‫יהוה‬, the Ålahým of Yasharʿål.”
   Dabarý Ha Yamým Býṭh/2Chr 6:10 Now Yahūah/‫ יהוה‬has established Åṭh/‫את‬-His Word which He spoke, and I have

    Gifts will be brought to Mount Tsýūn, the place of Sham/‫( שם‬Name) Yahūah/‫ יהוה‬Tsabʿåŭṭh.
    YashâYahū/Isa 24:15 Therefore, in the east give esteem to Yahūah/‫יהוה‬. Exalt Sham/‫( שם‬Name) Yahūah/‫יהוה‬, the

    YashâYahū/Isa 30:27 See, Sham/‫( שם‬Name) Yahūah/‫ יהוה‬comes from afar with burning anger and dense clouds of

Below is a list of various forms of words for the use of the Hebrew word Adan, translated Master in the English. Note how
                  extra characters are added to the three letter word to form a specific usage of possession.


‫ אדנ‬-        Ådan master – H113

‫אדני‬     -   Ådaný my master

‫ אדניו‬-      Ådanýū his master

‫ אדנינו‬-     Ådanýnū our master

‫ אדניהם‬-     Ådanýhm their master

‫ אדון‬-       Ådūn translated as your master also ‫הארץ‬-‫כל‬          ‫אדון‬   master of the whole earth

‫ האדנ יהוה‬H`âdan Yahūah – The Master Yahūah
-Adonai.
Adonai is the plural of Adon, meaning “Lord, Master, or owner” (the word Adon derives from a Ugaritic word meaning
“lord” or “father”). In the Tanakh, the word Adon can refer to men and angels as well as to the Lord God of Israel (e.g.,
Exodus 34: 23). God is called the “Lord of lords” (Deut 10:17) and Ps. 8:1 mentions God as “YHVH our Lord.”

The Plural form Adonai, like the plural form Elohim, is regularly used with singular verbs and modifiers, so it is best to
construe the Name as an “emphatic plural” or “plural of majesty.” When the plural is formed using a singular possessive
ending (“my Lords”), it always refers to God, and occurs over 300 times in the *Tanakh in this form.

The Masoretes ensured that the sacred Name of the Lord YHVH would not be taken in vain by putting the vowel marks for
Adonai under the letters ‫ה‬-‫ו‬-‫ה‬-‫ י‬in the running text. They did this to remind the reader to pronounce Adonai regardless of
the consonants in the text. However, Adon and Adonai also appear as Names of God in the Hebrew Masoretic text.

       After reading the above insert and the fearless practice inflicted on This Name ‫יהוה‬, let’s look at the
                                          commandment one more time.



“You shall not lift up (speak) ‫ את‬The Name of ‫ יהוה‬your Ålahým to ruin it, for ‫יהוה‬   ‫ את‬will not acquit (pardon) anyone
                                      who lifts up (speaks) ‫ את‬His Name to ruin it.

Section 3: Chap 17b

 For years I have read passages about praising, exulting and proclaiming The Name of my Creator. While working on this
 project, I was slowly led to look deeper into the word, “proclaim” (to call out;) because my research revealed a “teaching
   or doctrine” coming from the Jews that I never really payed much attention to. This “doctrine” leads the world into a
falsehood that Yahūah never taught His people. In fact the opposite is true. I have collected some notes on this subject and
                        felt it would be a subject of reasonable interest for the new student. Observe:

Dabarým/Deut 32:3 “For I proclaim (*call out) The Name of Yahūah/‫יהוה‬, ascribe (put in writing) greatness to our
Ålahým. – This passage is spoken by (Mashah/Moses) in a song, which later on, Yahūah instructs him to teach to the
children of Yasharʿål. Here are some definitions and their sources I dug up for this word, PROCLAIM.

Proclaim from: (BDB) H7121       ‫ = קרא‬to call, call out, recite, read, cry out, and proclaim; to utter a loud sound
                        to announce publicly; publish
British Dictionary Definition:
Word Origin and History for proclaim: late
                                    14c., proclamen, from Latin proclamare "cry or call out," from pro- "forth" (see pro- ) +
clamare "to cry out" (see claim (v.)). Spelling altered by influence of claim. Related: Proclaimed; proclaiming; proclaimer.

Now, as I said previously, I would stumble onto teachings from the Jews unexpectedly during the course of this project.
One of these teachings in question came up on the online etymology dictionary when I typed in “Masoretes.” Instead of
the program retrieving what I expected to be the origin for the word I typed in, this came up:

Jehovah
1530, Tyndale's erroneous transliteration of Hebrew Tetragramaton YHWH using vowel points of Adhonai "my lord" (see
Yahweh). Used for YHWH (the full name being too sacred for utterance) in four places in the Old Testament in the KJV where the
usual translation lord would have been inconvenient; taken as the principal and personal name of God. The vowel substitution was
originally made by the Masoretes as a direction to substitute Adhonai for "the ineffable name." European students of Hebrew took
this literally, which yielded Latin JeHoVa (first attested in writings of Galatinus, confessor to Leo X, 1516). Jehovah's Witnesses
"member of Watchtower Bible and Tract Society" first attested 1933; the organization founded c.1879 by Charles Taze Russell
(1852-1916); the name from Isa. xliii:10. Source: Online Etymology Dictionary

Here is a definition for “ineffable”:

Ineffable - not to be uttered: taboo <the ineffable name of Jehovah>
Online Source: (http://www.merriam-webster.com/dictionary/ineffable)
late 14c., from Old French ineffable (14c.) or directly from Latin ineffabilis "unutterable," from in- "not, opposite of" (see in- (1)) +
effabilis "speakable," from effari "utter," from ex- "out" (see ex-) + fari "speak" (see fame (n.)). Plural noun ineffables was, for a time,
a jocular euphemism for "trousers" (1823). Related: Ineffably.

Speaking This Name is not a sin! Using This Name to speak against, or commit an act against Yahūah and His Word is.
The 3rd commandment instructs us to guard against ruining His Name. We were never instructed to cease from speaking
His Name. This doctrine comes only from the Jewish community based on their Talmud. This teaching cannot be found
anywhere in Ṭūrah, the books of the Nabýʿåým, or other writings. Here is a passage where Yahūah has something to say
about His Own Name...

Shamūṭh/Ex 34:6 And Yahūah/‫ יהוה‬passed before him (Mashah/Moses) and proclaimed, “, Yahūah/‫יהוה‬,
Yahūah/‫יהוה‬, an Ål compassionate and showing favour, patient, and great in kindness and truth...” This was overlooked
apparently. Furthermore, here is a foretelling about His Name for the end days:

YaramYahū/Jer 33:16 ‘In those days Yahūdah shall be saved, and Yarūshalam dwell in safety. And this is that which
shall be proclaimed to her: ‘Yahūah/‫ יהוה‬our Righteousness.’ –Proclaim His Name! Anything else, is deceptive.

Section 3: Chap 18a

Below is a list of various forms of the Hebrew word “Ålahým” which cannot be found in any other language. Although, it
is widely taught that Ålahým is singular, this title is translated “Mighty ones”; referencing The Father and His Word in
this book. Note how a new character can stand in the place of another in the word to form a specific usage in Hebrew.
Many of these conjugated forms have been confirmed in my studies. However, some have not. Don’t be lazy in your
studies. Regardless of the source you collect your information from, make certain you can prove it over and over again in
the Hebrew text.

‫ = אלהים‬H430 Ålahým (mighty ones)
‫ = אלהיך‬Ålhýk - your Ålahým
‫ = אלהיהם‬Ålhýhk - their Ålahým
‫ = אלהי‬Ålhý - my Ålahým – may be in error: can be argued to be grammatically incorrect for Shamūth/Ex 3:15
‫ = אלהינו‬Ålhýnū - our Ålahým
‫ = אלהיו‬Ålhýū - his Ålahým
‫ = ה אלהים‬Ha Ålahým (the mighty ones)
‫= אלהיכם‬Ålhýkm (Used when Yahūah is speaking to a group of people in reference to Himself.)
‫= אליהם‬Ålýham “future tense” to them
‫= אלהם‬Ålham “perfect tense”
‫= ה אלה‬Ha Ålah these things
    Elohim
    Main article: Elohim
    (http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Names_of_God_in_Judaism#Eloah)
    A common name of *God in the Hebrew Bible is Elohim (Hebrew: About this sound ‫( אלהים‬help·info)). Despite the -im ending
    common to many plural nouns in Hebrew, the word Elohim when referring to *God is grammatically singular, and takes a singular
    verb in the Hebrew Bible. The word is identical to the usual plural of el meaning gods or magistrates, and is cognate to the 'lhm
    found in Ugaritic, where it is used for the pantheon of Canaanite gods, the children of El and conventionally vocalized as "Elohim"
    although the original Ugaritic vowels are unknown. When the Hebrew Bible uses elohim not in reference to God, it is plural (for
    example, Exodus 20:3). There are a few other such uses in Hebrew, for example Behemoth. In Modern Hebrew, the singular word
    ba'alim ("owner", "lord", or "husband") looks plural, but likewise takes a singular verb.


 The viewpoint suggested in the above Wikipedia insert calls for scrutiny and suspicion as we observe the next chapter:

Yahūah begins with, “Let Us make man in our image” indicating that Ålahým in reference to The Father and His Word
is most certainly plural. One could bring this passage into the equation:
Dabarým/Deut 6:4 “Hear, O Yasharʿål: Yahūah/‫ יהוה‬our Ålahým/‫ אלהים‬, Yahūah/‫ יהוה‬is one.
This passage is misleading us because of a mistranslation. This passage of scripture is discussed in the next chapter.
However, I would like to share my thoughts on the following passage:
Shamūṭh/Ex 4:16 “And he shall speak for you to the people. And it shall be that he shall be a mouth for you, and you
shall be an Ålahým for him.
If a message is being delivered whereas; the message comes from a higher authority, this equates to two beings at work:

I have learned that the house of Yasharʿål did not have knowledge of The Word, as much as we think they did (YaramYahū/Jer
2:31-35). In Shamūṭh 4:14, Yahūah becomes angry with Mashah (Moses). Why? Because Mashah told Yahūah to send or
use someone else to speak His Word. That was a serious bummer to Yahūah. So, Yahūah said that He would have his
brother, Åharan, speak for Mashah. So, here is how it went down: Mashah tells his brother what to speak. But The Word he
tells his brother is not his own, but the Word given by Yahūah. This makes Mashah an Ålahým to Åharan because Åharan
is speaking what Mashah tells him to by the authority of one greater than himself (Compare Shamūṭh/Ex 7:1). This Word is
not coming from Mashah, but from Yahūah. On a side note: this is how Yahūah had to deal with His people constantly,
because they were more than often telling Him they did not want to hear from Him. If you study the text in the majority of
the Ṭūrah, you will notice Yahūah was forced to resort to a “plan B” scenario on many occasions as a result of the hard
hearts of this people.
Many scholars and Jewish (Ashkenazim) teachers are convinced, that Ålahým is singular when this title is used for rulers
or those in high authority such as magistrates or gods. This includes its use in reference to The Creator. Their argument is
firm in that it is plural when used in Shamūṭh/Ex 20:3 “Have no other Ålahým (gods) in my face”. We can go back and
forth on this all day. When one is convinced in his heart on a matter, only Yahūah can change that point of view through
seeking Him with all his might. If of course, he is so prompted to do just that on this particular subject. I disagree with the
published traditional view on “Ålahým” and here is why. The Word of Yahūah, has never spoken on His own authority in
the OT or the NT, ever. (Yahūcḥanan/Jn 7:16-19, 8:28, 38, 14:10, 24, 15:15)

If you do not know who Yahūshâ is, you cannot understand The Word of Yahūah. If at any degree, you have rejected, or
are in disagreement with The Spoken or Written Word of Yahūah (Ṭūrah), you will never know Yahūshâ. That is a fact.
Now let’s consider the following passages of scripture. Yahūah said, there is no one beside Him (YashâYahū/Isa 44:8, 45:5,
45:21). These passages declare there is no other Ål/‫( אל‬mighty one) to seek. If man imagines there are, it is a lie. Now,
this leads us to believe He is only one, right? This means, there is no word that supersedes The Word of The Father, and
there is no other Father (MaṭhaṭhYahū/Matt 23:8-10). So, there is only One Voice that comes from The Father: His Word!

Let’s look at this in light of what He said, throughout the Ṭūrah and the accounts of Yahūshâ. Don’t forget, that man is
notorious for not wanting to hear from Yahūah directly! (Shamūṭh/Ex 4:13, 20:19; Dabarým/Deut 5:25-27 etc...) The children
of Yasharʿål appoints Mashah as their leader; the one they will hear (obey); the one they will hear as if it were Yahūah
himself! This was clear. Mashah was the only one who drew near to Yahūah; they shrank back and said, “You go and
talk to Him. Don’t let Him speak to us anymore or we will die! We will hear from you (Dabarým 5:25-27).” Later, they
gave him a hard time about this arrangement that they asked for by saying, “Is it little that you have brought us up out of
a land flowing with milk and honey, to kill us in the wilderness, that you would also seize total rule over us?” B-
madbar/Num 16:13. In B-mdbar 16:28 it was proven, that the works he (Mashah) did, were not from his own heart. He
was listening to Yahūah directly. The people wanted to hear from Mashah only. Truly, this was an obstinate people.

With that as a foundation, I want to look at YashâYahū/Isa 53:9. The foretelling states, the Mashýacḥ would have no deceit
in His mouth. This is supported by Yahūcḥanan/Jn 1:47 and 1Pet 2:22. Now keep in mind, there is no other mighty one but
Yahūah according to YashâYahū, chapters 44 and 45. If I haven’t lost you, look now in YaramYahū 11:17-19. Yahūah is
speaking evil against who He planted (His people). This was a foretelling of Mashýacḥ here. They were cutting off the
commandments. What is always being planted by Yahūah? His Word in the hearts of His people (Matt 13:1-23). Yes, they
were planted in that land to grow...but from what? If they rejected The Word, then the tree (Yasharʿål) is fruitless. What did
they reject? Ṭūrah! Their salvation; Righteousness and covering. The commands; statutes and Right-Rulings. They were
planted to be a light to the nations, which in turn, the nations would learn this Law from them. This arrangement was
supposed to attract the nations to learn This Law of Yahūah (Dabarým/Deut 4:6). But they hated Ṭūrah. Yasharʿål and
Yahūdah detested The Law or Word of Yahūah (Dabarým 8:3). They were cursed for cutting off Ṭūrah (YaramYahū 11:3).
Fast forward to the days of Mashýacḥ. With no deceit in His Mouth, He claimed to be The Bread of life (Yahūcḥanan/Jn
6:58). Compare this saying with Dabarým/Deut 32:46-47. He claimed to exist before Åbraham (Yahūcḥanan/Jn 8:58).
Compare this saying with Shamūṭh/Ex 3:14. As soon as they saw The Word manifested in the flesh, they did what they
have always done. They cut their life; bread; salvation and righteousness off from themselves (Yahūcḥanan/Jn 6:54, 7:18,
8:37,10:28-29, 14:6 ). His people fulfilled the foretelling’s of Mashýacḥ by butchering Him. He claims to have been sent
                                                                                                           Page 134 of 396

from The Father (Yahūcḥanan/Jn 14:24). Let’s capsulize this: Mashýacḥ claims that The Words He speaks are not His, but
His Fathers. They are not His own works. Just like what Mashah said. The messenger and the message given by a higher
authority are two beings at work here (Yahūcḥanan/Jn 10:29; 14:24, 28). Yasharʿål could not understand this. Yahūshâ
explained to His taught ones in Luke 24:27 all the things that pertained to Him in the Ṭūrah and in the Nabýʿåým. He is
telling them or have been telling them rather, that He is the guy that has been dealing with them the whole time. Even back
before Åbraham. Yet nobody has seen the Father, other than The Word (YashâYahū/Isa 44:8, 45:5, 45:21). With that said, let’s
take a good look at Ṭahalým/Ps 110. Stay with me, I am building a case here.

Ṭahalým/Ps 110:1-7 ‫ יהוה‬said to my Master, “Sit at My right hand, Until I make Your enemies a footstool for Your feet.
2
 ‫ יהוה‬sends Your mighty scepter out of Tsýūn. Rule in the midst of Your enemies! 3Your people volunteer in the day of
Your might, in the splendors of set-apartness! From the womb, from the morning, You have the dew of Your youth! 4 ‫יהוה‬
has sworn and does not relent, “You are a Kahan forever according to the order of Malakýtsadaq.” 5 ‫ יהוה‬at Your right
hand Shall smite sovereigns in the day of His wrath. 6He judges among the nations, He shall fill the nations with dead
bodies, He shall crush the Head over the mighty earth! 7He drinks of the stream by the wayside. Therefore, He does lift up
the head!


In verse four, Malakýtsadaq is from H4442: ‫צדך‬-‫מלכי‬. This name carries two roots: H4428 and H6664. These two roots
tell us the meaning of this “MLKÝ-TSDK”. The H4428 is “King”. If you attach the Yd (‫)י‬, it becomes “my king”. The
H6664 means: justice; righteousness; rightness. So, this name would mean: “My King is Righteous” or “Righteous is My
King”. What does this have to do with my understanding of Ålahým in a plural form? Well, this song is a foretelling of
Mashýacḥ. By studying all the foretelling’s of Mashýacḥ in the Ṭūrah (Law or teachings of Yahūah), you will see that
every Word spoken by Yahūah; that His people were instructed to obey, has saving power in it. Why, how and when does
His Word have saving power in it? Does His Word have saving power in it only when we read it in the New Testament, or
is saving power available in that spoken or written word when we hear it, read and obey it in the Old Testament; as long
as we know it came from the mouth of Yahūah? In every instance Yahūah spoke in the Old Testament, that word spoken
is life to us. If I can prove the Word spoken by Yahūah, is Mashýacḥ in the Old Testament, then every Word spoken by
Mashýacḥ in the New Testament; would then be subject to every Word written in the Old Testament, that came out of the
mouth of Yahūah, right? The following, is how to prove two beings at work by our Mashýacḥ. Yet He said to His taught
ones, that His Father is greater (Yahūcḥanan/Jn 14:28).

                                                  Dabarým/Deut 8:3
“And He humbled you, and let you suffer hunger, and fed you with manna which you did not know nor did your fathers
know, to make you know that man does not live by bread alone, but by every Word that comes from the mouth of ‫יהוה‬.

Yahūcḥanan/Jn 6:31-35 “Our fathers ate the manna in the wilderness, as it has been written, ‘He gave them bread out
of the heaven to eat.’ ” 32Therefore ‫ יהושע‬said to them, “Truly, truly, I say to you, Mashah did not give you the bread out
of the heaven, but My Father gives you the true bread out of the heaven. 33For the bread of Ålahým is He who comes
down out of the heaven and gives life to the world. 34So they said to Him, “Master, give us this bread always. 35And
‫ יהושע‬said to them, “I am the bread of life. He who comes to Me shall not get hungry at all, and he who believes in Me
shall not get thirsty at all.


Does this mean that Yahūshâ Ha Mashýacḥ is replacing the Word of the OT, or is He confirming the Word spoken in the
OT? I want to compare what Yahūshâ said, with what is written about the Ṭūrah...
       Yahūshâ claims:
Therefore ‫ יהושע‬spoke to them again, saying, “I am the light of the world. He who follows Me shall by no means walk in
                      darkness, but possess the light of life.” Yahūcḥanan/Jn 8:12 (Jn 9:5, 11:10)
                                                                                                                 Page 135 of 396

YashâYahū /Isa 51:4, 5 “Listen to Me, My people, and give ear to Me, O My nation, for the Ṭūrah goes forth from Me,
and My right-ruling I set as a light to peoples. 5My righteousness is near, My deliverance shall go forth, and My arms
judge peoples. Coastlands wait upon Me, and for My arm they wait expectantly.

Here, in YashâYahū, the Law and Right-Ruling is set as a light. Mashýacḥ said in Yahūcḥanan that He is the light.
       Yahūshâ claims:
“I have come as a light into the world, so that no one who believes in Me should stay in darkness. Yahūcḥanan/Jn 12:46
                    (Yahūcḥanan/Jn 12:36) If right-ruling of Yahūah is avoided or hidden, you are in darkness.
Now, let’s see what was declared about the Ṭūrah:
YashâYahū/Isa 8:20 To the Ṭūrah and to the testimony! If they do not speak according to this Word, it is because they
have no light in them . (YashâYahū/Isa 9:2, 59:9, Ṭahalým/Ps 119:105, Mashlý/Prov 28:9) By refusing the Law, you refuse light.

Here, YashâYahū, the servant known today as Isaiah, says that if one speaks against the Ṭūrah, there is no light in them.
Yahūshâ Ha Mashýacḥ states that He came as a light into the world, so that all those believing what comes from His
mouth, should lead them out of darkness; lawlessness. This suggests He is speaking about The Law that is written. In
other words, if He does not speak according to the Ṭūrah, there is no light in Him. Could He be The Living Ṭūrah? I
believe He is. This would also mean, that anyone who draws you away from the Ṭūrah, or tries to persuade you to think
the Ṭūrah is no longer a light to us, than that teacher is a false teacher. Remember, there is only one teacher; that is
Mashýacḥ (MaṭhaṭhYahū/Matt 23:8). You cannot reject Ṭūrah and say you believe Mashýacḥ. Mashýacḥ and Ṭūrah agree;
one and the same, synonymous; identical in image through behavior and speech. One does not resist the other.

       Yahūshâ claims: ‫ יהושע‬said to him, “I am the Way, and the Truth, and the Life. No one comes to the Father
        except through Me.” Yahūcḥanan/Jn 14:6

    1. Dabarým/Deut 6:24 ‘And ‫ יהוה‬commanded us to do all these laws, to fear ‫ יהוה‬our Ålahým, for our good always,
       to keep us alive, as it is today.
    2. Dabarým/Deut6:25 ‘And it is righteousness for us when we guard to do all this command before ‫ יהוה‬our
       Ålahým, as He has commanded us.’

    3. Dabarým/Deut32:4 “The Rock! His work is perfect, for all His ways are Right-Ruling, An Ål of truth and
       without unrighteousness, Righteous and straight is He.

    4. Ṭahalým/Ps 119:142 Your righteousness is righteousness forever, And Your Ṭūrah is truth. (Ps 119:151)

    5. NacḥamYah/Neh 9:13 “And You came down on Mount Sýný, and spoke with them from the heavens, and gave
       them straight right-rulings and Ṭūrah of truth, good laws and commands.(NacḥamYah/Neh 9:33)

These five witnesses clearly tell us that Truth, Life, Righteousness, perfect works; straightness, and Ṭūrah are
interchangeable in the OT. Let’s get organized, and match these claims up:

       I am the Way: from G3598 – way/ὁδός – Hodos or odos and H1870 - way/‫ דרך‬Darak
        BDB definition for both Greek and Hebrew: manner; habit; way; course of life; moral character

        Looking for this word way Yahūshâ claimed to be, that matches the way of Yahūah in the OT:
        Shamūṭh/Ex 23:20: “...guard you in The Way...”
        Shamūṭh/Ex 33:13: “...show me now Your Way...”
        Dabarým/Deut 8:6: “...to walk in His Ways...”
        Dabarým/Deut 10:12; 11:22; 19:9; 26:17; 28:9; 30:16: “...fear Yahūah your Ålahým to walk in all His Ways; to
        love Him...”

        Turning aside from the way:
        Dabarým/Deut 9:12: “...they quickly turned aside out of The Way which I have commanded them...”
                                                                                                         Page 136 of 396

        Dabarým/Deut 11:28: “...If you do not obey, but turn aside from The Way...”
        Dabarým/Deut 28:68: “...by a Way I said to you,’You shall never see it again’...”
        Dabarým/Deut 31:29: “...utterly corrupt yourselves and turn aside from The Way which I have commanded...”

Dabarým/Deut 32:4 states that “all His Ways are Right-Ruling”. Yahūshâ claims to be “The Way”. This is a match.

       I am the Truth: from G225 – truth/ ἀλήθεια – Aletheia - meaning: what is true - from the G227- ἀληθής –
        Alethes - meaning: true; speaking the truth - from G1 – Alpha which is of Hebrew origin meaning: Ålaph/‫– א‬
        This would suggest He is claiming, the “truth” and “beginning” are one in the same. The ‫ את‬is a signature of The
        Word of Yahūah seen throughout the scriptures. The ‫ א‬represents the beginning, and the ‫ ת‬represents the end. The
        G227 has a second root: G2990 - λανθάνω – lanthano -meaning: to be hidden; secret. Is the truth hidden? (He is
        the beginning-Rev 1:8, 3:14, 21:6, 22:13)
        -   and H571 - truth/‫ אמת‬åmaṭh – meaning: firmness; stability; faithfulness – from H539 – åman/‫אמן‬
            meaning: to support; confirm; be faithful. We use this word at the end of our prayers. Learning the meaning of
            this word, should change the way we think and trust after we pray.

      Looking for this word truth Yahūshâ claimed to be, that matches the truth of Yahūah in the OT:
      Shamūṭh/Ex 34:6: “...abundant in goodness and truth...”
      Dabarým/Deut 32:4: “...A Mighty One of truth; without unrighteousness...”
      NacḥamYah/Neh 9:13: “...and gave them straight right-rulings and Ṭūrah of truth...”
      NacḥamYah/Neh 9:33: “...you have done truth, but we have done wrong.”
      Ṭahalým/Ps 25:5: “...lead me in your truth...”
      Ṭahalým/Ps 25:10: “...all the ways of Yahūah are kindness and truth...”
      Ṭahalým/Ps 43:3: “Send forth Your Light and Your truth.”
      Ṭahalým/Ps 86:11: “Teach me Your way Yahūah; let me walk in your truth...”
      Ṭahalým/Ps 111:7; 119:30: “The works of His hands are truth and right-ruling...”
      Ṭahalým/Ps 119:142, 151, 160; Yachazaqaʿål/Eze 18:9; Malʿåký/Mal 2:6-8: “...and Your Ṭūrah is truth.”
Ṭahalým/Ps 119:142 states that, “Your Ṭūrah is truth.” Yahūshâ claims to be The Truth. This is a match.

       I am the Life: from G2222 – life/ ζωή – Zoe - meaning: fullness of life; possessed of vitality – from G2198 –
        ζάω - Zao - meaning: to live breathe; be among the living and H2416 - life/‫ חי‬Cḥý meaning: living; alive; living
        thing – from H2421 – Cḥýah/‫ חיה‬meaning: to live; have life; to remain alive; to preserve alive

        Looking for this word life Yahūshâ claimed to be, that matches the life of Yahūah in the OT:
        Dabarým/Deut 30:15: “...I set before you today, life, and good and evil...”
        Dabarým/Deut 30:19: “...you shall choose life...”
        Dabarým/Deut 30:20: “...cling to Him, for He is your life, and the length of your days...”
        Dabarým/Deut 32:47: “...it is your life, and by this Word you prolong your days...”
        NacḥamYah/Neh 9:6: “...you give life to them all...”
        Ṭahalým/Ps 16:11: “...show me the way of life...”
        Ṭahalým/Ps 36:9: “...with You is the fountain of life...”
        Ṭahalým/Ps 119:93: “...Your orders have given me life...”
        Mashalý/Prov 6:23: “...the Ṭūrah is light, reproofs of instruction are the way of life...”

Dabarým/Deut 6:24 states that, ‘And ‫ יהוה‬commanded us to do all these laws, to fear ‫ יהוה‬our Ålahým, for our good
always, to preserve us alive.” Yahūshâ claims to be The life. This is a match. The Ṭūrah is The Way, The Truth, and The
life. Yahūshâ is The Teacher; The Living Ṭūrah. The Word of life was given from the beginning, and has been rejected to
this very day. Has He been telling His taught ones; that He is the Word that worked righteousness in the OT, but was “cut
off” from His people?
                                                                                                           Page 137 of 396

YashâYahū/Isa 53:7-12 He was oppressed and He was afflicted, but He did not open His mouth. He was led as a lamb to
the slaughter, and as a sheep before its shearers is silent, but He did not open His mouth. 8 He was taken from prison and
from judgment. And as for His generation, who considered that He shall be cut off from the land of the living? For the
transgression of My people He was stricken. 9He was appointed a grave with the wrong, and with the rich at His death,
because He had done no violence, nor was deceit in His mouth. 10But ‫ יהוה‬was pleased to crush Him. He laid sickness on
Him, that when He made Himself an offering for guilt, He would see a seed; He would prolong His days and the pleasure
of ‫ יהוה‬prosper in His hand. 11He would see the result of the suffering of His life and be satisfied. Through His knowledge
My righteous Servant makes many righteous, and He bears their crookedness. 12Therefore I give Him a portion among the
great, and He divides the spoil with the strong, because He poured out His being unto death, and He was counted with
the transgressors, and He bore the sin of many, and made intercession for the transgressors (Compare: YaramYahū11:19).

YashâYahū/Isa 59:14 And right-ruling is driven back, and righteousness stands far off. For truth has fallen in the street,
and right is unable to enter.

YaramYahū/Jer 23:5 “See, the days are coming,” declares ‫יהוה‬, “when I shall raise for Dūýd a Branch of
righteousness, and a Sovereign shall reign and act wisely, and shall do right-ruling and righteousness in the earth.

YaramYahū/Jer 23:6 “In His days Yahūdah shall be saved, and Yasharʿål dwell safely. And this is His Name whereby
He shall be called: ‘‫ יהוה‬our Righteousness.’ (Remember, Ps 110: 1-7; ‫צדך‬-‫ מלכי‬- “MLKÝ-TSDK” “My King is Righteous”
p. 134 )


          Yahūshâ claimed:“He who possesses My commands and guards them, it is he who loves Me. He who loves Me
           shall be loved by My Father. I shall love him and manifest Myself to him.” Yahūcḥanan/Jn 14:21) Clearly, there
           are two at work in this passage. (MathathYahu/Matt 12:47-50

Didn’t Yahūah say the same thing in the OT?
   1. Shamūṭh/Exod 20:6 but showing kindness to thousands, to those who love Me and guard My commands.

    2. Dabarým/Deut 6:5, 6 “And you shall love ‫ יהוה‬your Ålahým with all your heart, and with all your being, and
       with all your might. 6And these Words which I am commanding you today shall be in your heart...”

    3. Dabarým/Deut 7:9 “And you shall know that ‫ יהוה‬your Ålahým, He is Ålahým, the trustworthy Ål guarding
       covenant and kindness for a thousand generations with those who love Him, and those who guard His
       commands...”

    4. Dabarým/Deut 7:11-13 “And you shall guard the command, and the laws, and the right-rulings which I
       command you today, to do them. 12And it shall be, because you hear these right-rulings, and shall guard and do
       them, that ‫ יהוה‬your Ålahým shall guard with you the covenant and the kindness which He swore to your fathers,
       13
         and shall love you and favor you and increase you, and shall favor the fruit of your womb and the fruit of your
       land, your grain and your new wine and your oil, the increase of your cattle and the offspring of your flock, in the
       land of which He swore to your fathers to give you.”

    5. Dabarým/Deut 13:3, 4 Do not listen to the words of that nabýå or that dreamer of dreams, for ‫ יהוה‬your Ålahým
       is trying you to know whether you love ‫ יהוה‬your Ålahým with all your heart and with all your being. 4Walk after
       ‫ יהוה‬your Ålahým and fear Him, and guard His commands and obey His Voice, and serve Him and cling to
       Him.(Jn 15:14,15)

Yahūshâ also warns us about guarding these commands again in Cḥazūn/Rev 12:17, 14:12, 22:14. (Zeph 2:3)
                                                                                                            Page 138 of 396

       Yahūshâ claimed: MaṭhaṭhYahū/Matt 7:21 “Not everyone who says to Me, ‘Master, Master,’ shall enter into the
        reign of the heavens, but he who is doing the desire of My Father in the heavens. (MaṭhaṭYahū 5:19, 7:24; Luke
        8:21; 11:28; Mark 4:20)


What does the OT say about doing the desire or will of The Father?
    1. Yahūʿål/Joel 2:11 And ‫ יהוה‬shall give forth His Voice before His army, for His camp is very great, for mighty is
       the doer of His Word. For the day of ‫ יהוה‬is great and very terrifying, and who does bear it?


    2. Ṭahalým/Ps 111:1-10 Praise ‫ !יה‬I thank ‫ יהוה‬with all my heart; in the company of the straight, and of the
       congregation. 2Great are the works of ‫יהוה‬, searched for by all who delight in them. 3Splendour and greatness
       are His work, and His righteousness stands forever. 4He has made His wonders to be remembered; ‫ יהוה‬shows
       favor and is compassionate. 5He has given food to those who fear Him; He remembers His covenant forever. 6He
       has shown His people the power of His works, To give to them the inheritance of the gentiles. 7The works of His
       hands are truth and right-ruling. All His orders are trustworthy. 8They are upheld forever and ever; Performed in
       truth and straightness. 9He sent redemption to His people. He has commanded His covenant forever. Set-Apart
       and Terrifying is His Name. 10The fear of ‫ יהוה‬is the beginning of wisdom. All those doing them (His Right-
       Rulings in vs. 7) have a good understanding. His praise is standing forever.

    3. Dabarým/Deut 11:22 ‘For if you diligently guard all these commands which I command you, to do it, to love
       ‫ יהוה‬your Ålahým, to walk in all His Ways, and to cling to Him (James 1:22).”

    4. Dabarým/Deut 15:5 “...only if you diligently obey The Voice of ‫ יהוה‬your Ålahým, to guard to do all these
       Commands which I am commanding you today. (YashâYahū/Isa 44:8, 45:5, 45:21).

    5. Dabarým/Deut 28:15 “And it shall be, if you do not obey The Voice of ‫ יהוה‬your Ålahým, to guard to do all His
       Commands and His Laws which I command you today, that all these curses shall come upon you and overtake
       you (James 1:21, 2). There is only One Voice that comes from the mouth of Yahūah. His Word (Dabarým 8:3)

Looking back at Ṭahalým/Ps 111: 1-10, it becomes clear, that the works of “His” hands are the Ṭūrah. We learned previously
that Truth, Righteousness, Life and The Ṭūrah are interchangeable terms. Right-Ruling is also a term used for “Judgements”.
These terms are all referring to Ṭūrah. Verse nine states, “He sent redemption to His people.” The redemption sent was the
Ṭūrah they rejected. This Ṭūrah is the Word of Yahūah. Had they known how precious these words were, they would have
clung to them. This Ṭūrah has saving power in it because it is full of Life (Deut 32:47; James 1:21). He has been proclaiming
this from the very beginning. Do the command, and live (Ū Yaqrå/Lev 18:5; Mashalý/Prov 4:4, 7:2; Qhalaṭh/Ecc 12:13). Yahūah
rejects those who rejects this Ṭūrah (Dabarým/Deut 31:15-18, Mashlý/Prov 28:9). He even commands us to “choose Life” in
Dabarým/Deut 30:19: “I have called the heavens and the earth as witnesses today against you: I have set before you Life
and Death, The Barakah and the curse. Therefore you shall choose Life, so that you live, both you and your seed...”
Also, remember what Yahūshâ said, “I Am The Way, The Truth, and The Life. No one comes to The Father except through
Me.” Yahūcḥanan/Jn 14:6 (Prov 4:4, 7:2)
I think I have given enough evidence to prove Yahūshâ is the Word/Law/Ṭūrah, manifested in the flesh. This Word was
given in the Old Testament to rule and lead His people to long life, Peace and Right Standing with The Father. He gave The
Word to them to lead the rest of the nations to be a light to them; so the nations would say, “What a wise and understanding
people is this nation” (Dabarým/Deut 4:6). The Word, Yahūshâ, often spoke of His Father in the written accounts of His life.
There are two at work here: The Word sent from The Father, who is doing the work of The Father; and The Father. The
Word, who is Yahūshâ, and The Father are Ålahým. I discuss this title, “Ålahým” further in the next chapter.

Section 3: Chap 18b


        Cḥazūn/Rev 19:13 He is clothed in a garment sprinkled with blood. His Name is called “The Word of        Hwhy”.
This section can easily offend many. What most people cannot see or understand, is that The Word of Yahūah is The One
who dealt with the House of Yasharʿål from the very beginning. Yet, all of us understand, the Mashýacḥ spoke of His
Father. Also, we understand that Mashah (Moses) wrote about Mashýacḥ. If The Word of Yahūah is sent to earth, then
the Father still remains in the Heavens: Yahūah above, and Yahūah is on the earth; through His Word. Yet no one has
seen The Father according to Yahūcḥanan/John 6:46. Man has only seen what The Father brought forth from His mouth:
The Word; which was spoken, written and manifested in the flesh. The Word of The Father has been dealing with
mankind, to get him prepared, and ready to stand before The Father; so that he will not perish in His Wrath. This Word
sent, is the image and salvation of The Father; in the form of Commandments and Right-Rulings. We reject His image, by
refusing the instructions given to us, in the form of the words/instructions given by Yahūah. Give yourself over to those
words, and you have given yourself over to The Image of The Father. Following Yahūshâ, and His behavior and
instruction, will reveal what that image is. Guarding The Commands and Right-Rulings of Yahūah is embracing The
Father. In Yahūcḥanan/John 5:47, Yahūshâ said, “For if you believed Mashah, you would have believed Me, since he
wrote about Me.” I believe it was The Word of Yahūah who spoke to Mashah in the burning bush; He steered a multitude
out of Matsarým, across the Red Sea; and gave a list of instructions to that same multitude to be an example for all the
nations.

In Yahūcḥanan/John 14:9, Yahūshâ said, “Have I been with you so long, and you have not known Me, Philip? He who
has seen Me has seen the Father, and how do you say, ‘Show us the Father’? But wait, He says something interesting
again in Yahūcḥanan/John 6:46: “Not that anyone has seen the Father except the one who is from Yahūah – He has seen
the Father.” And again in verse 57, “Just as the living Father sent Me, and I live because of the Father, so the one who
consumes Me will live because of Me.”(Dabarým 8:3 tells us every word from the mouth of Yahūah is to be consumed (obeyed).

In Shamūṭh/Ex 3:14, it is said, “I am that which I am.” And He said, “Thus you shall say to the children of Yasharʿål, ‘I
am has sent me to you.’ ” In Yahūcḥanan/John 8:58, Yahūshâ said to them, “Truly, truly, I say to you, before Åbraham
came to be, I am.” And yet again, “For I have not spoken from my own authority, but the Father Himself who sent Me has
commanded Me what I should say and what I should speak.” Yahūcḥanan/John 12:47-49. Clearly, there are two here.
He is the Word of The Father. 1. FATHER 2. WORD

It was The Word that did the work of creating the earth. It was The Word who led Åbraham, Yatscḥaq, and Yʿâqb. It was
the Word that came forth to draw a multitude out of Matsarým. It was The Word that was brought forth consistently to
His people, through the Nabýå; begging them to stop discarding and butchering those instructions given to them. This
was meant to prepare and dress them; so they would be received by The Father, and then the rest of the nations would
have followed suit. It was The Word that was sent forth; manifested in the flesh, begging His people again and again, to
stop discarding The Word; which is the image of The Father. Yahūah wanted His people to embrace His Word, so that
His Word could save them from His Wrath; coming from the curses promised to them within the covenant. Just as this
same people butchered and discarded The Word sent forth; in the form of instructions, they now had ample opportunity to
tear The Image of The Father (The fullness of Right-Ruling) to pieces in the form of flesh, and watch that image bleed.
They could finally touch what they have been hating from the very beginning, for so long. They showed The Father how
they really felt about those Commands (Yahūcḥanan/Jn 15:24). Disdain for The Law/Ṭūrah, is disdain for The Word.
Disdain for The Word, is disdain for the Father. The Law or The Word, is The Image of The Father.

The following, is something I believe some will find curious: if you have ears to hear. Others may find it offensive and
refuse to study it out. We all have been told so many lies, and have built for ourselves a default, we immediately fall prey
to as our safe place. Nobody wants to be deceived or tricked. Yet, I find within this age of darkness, that has swallowed
up the inhabitants of the earth in these last days; many of those who fear being misled, refuse to come out of the darkness
they live in, given to them by their fathers. Darkness is that which does not agree with The Word that was given from the
                                                                                                         Page 140 of 396

beginning. I have been learning some things about our English translation. I am compelled to share what I have been
learning about this subject. Carefully observe the following passages.

Hear O Yasharʿål: Yahūah our Ålahým; Yahūah is One! (Dabarým/Deut 6:4). Has this passage of scripture been translated
correctly? If there were any evidence to the contrary, would we believe what the message is in the text given by Yahūah
from the beginning, or would we discard it because it would not fit the tradition we are so used to? How do we really
view the Word of Yahūah? Are we not hearing Him at all? After the following passages have been absorbed, I will share
what has been given to me about Dabarým/Deut 6:4. Then you can decide for yourself whether there are two at work as
opposed to one.

        The following list of scriptures, will certainly cause one to stop and ponder: Ålahým, The Mighty Ones.


        B-rʿåshýṭh/Gen 1:26 And Ålahým/‫( אלהים‬Mighty Ones) said, “Let Us make man in Our image, according to Our
        likeness, and let them rule over the fish of the sea, and over the birds of the heavens, and over the livestock,
        and over all the earth and over all the creeping creatures that creep on the earth.”
        B-rʿåshýṭh/Gen 1:27 So Ålahým/‫( אלהים‬Mighty Ones) created man in His own image, in the image of
        Ålahým/‫( אלהים‬Mighty Ones) He created him; male and female He created them.
        B-rʿåshýṭh/Gen 3:22 And Yahūah/‫ יהוה‬Ålahým/‫ אלהים‬said, “See, the man has become like one of Us, to know
        good and evil. And now, lest he put out his hand and take also of the tree of life, and eat, and live forever...”
        B-rʿåshýṭh/Gen 11:6, 7 And Yahūah/‫ יהוה‬said, “Look, they are one people and they all have one language, and
        this is what they begin to do! And now, they are not going to be withheld from doing whatever they plan to do.
        7
         Come, let Us go there and confuse their language, so that they do not understand one another’s speech.”
        B-rʿåshýṭh/Gen 19:24 And Yahūah/‫( יהוה‬Yahūah on earth) rained Sulphur and fire on Sadam and Åmarah, from
        Yahūah/‫ יהוה‬out of the heavens.
        Shamūṭh/Ex 9:5 And Yahūah/‫ יהוה‬set an appointed time, saying, “Tomorrow, Yahūah/‫ יהוה‬is going to do this
        word in the land.”
        Shamūṭh/Ex 19:10,11 And Yahūah/‫ יהוה‬said unto Mashah, “Go unto the people, and make them Set-Apart
        today and tomorrow, and let them wash their clothes, and be ready against the third day; for the third day
        Yahūah/‫ יהוה‬will come down in the sight of all the people upon mount Sýný.” (The Father speaks, The Word works)
        Shamūṭh/Ex 19:21 And Yahūah/‫ יהוה‬said unto Mashah, “Go down, charge the people, lest they break through
        unto Yahūah/‫ יהוה‬to gaze, and many of them perish.”
        Shamūṭh/Ex 19:22 “And let the Kahaným also, which come near to Yahūah/‫יהוה‬, set themselves apart, lest
        Yahūah/‫ יהוה‬break forth upon them.”
        Shamūṭh/Ex 19:24 And Yahūah/‫ יהוה‬said unto him, “Away, get down, and you shalt come up, you, and Åharan
        with you; but let not the Kahaným and the people break through to come up unto Yahūah/‫יהוה‬, lest He break
        forth upon them.”
        Shamūṭh/Ex 34:5 And Yahūah/‫ יהוה‬descended in the cloud, and stood with him there, and proclaimed The
        Name of Yahūah/‫יהוה‬.
        Shamūṭh/Ex 34:6 And Yahūah/‫ יהוה‬passed by before him, and proclaimed, “Yahūah/‫יהוה‬, Yahūah/‫ יהוה‬-
        Ål/‫אל‬, (mighty one) Merciful and Kind, Longsuffering, and abundant in Goodness and Truth…” (The Word is
        speaking about His Father’s Name and character here.)
        B-madbar/Num 25:4 And Yahūah/‫ יהוה‬said unto Mashah, “Take all the heads of the people, and hang them up
        before Yahūah/‫ יהוה‬against the sun, that The Fierce Anger of Yahūah/‫ יהוה‬may be turned away from
        Yasharʿål.”
        B-madbar/Num 11:23 And Yahūah/‫ יהוה‬said unto Mashah, “Is Yahūah/‫ יהוה‬hand waxed short? You will see
        now whether My Word shall come to pass unto you or not.”
                                                                                                   Page 141 of 396

B-madbar/Num 18:19 All the heave offerings of the Set-Apart things, which the children of Yasharʿål offer unto
Yahūah/‫יהוה‬, have I given thee, and thy sons and thy daughters with thee, by a Statute forever: it is a Covenant
of Salt for ever before Yahūah/‫ יהוה‬unto thee and to thy seed with thee.
Dabarým/Deut 5:5 I stood between Yahūah/‫ יהוה‬and you at that time, to show you The Word of Yahūah/‫יהוה‬:
for ye were afraid by reason of the fire, and went not up into the mount; saying…”
Dabarým/Deut 6:4 Hear, Yasharʿål: Yahūah/‫ יהוה‬Ålahýnū/‫( אלהינו‬our Mighty Ones), Yahūah/‫ יהוה‬only!
Shamūʿål Ålaph/1 Sam 3:7 Now Shamūʿål did not yet know Yahūah/‫יהוה‬, neither was The Word of
Yahūah/‫ יהוה‬yet revealed unto him.
Shamūʿål Ålaph/1 Sam 3:21 And Yahūah/‫ יהוה‬appeared again in Shalah: for Yahūah/‫ יהוה‬revealed himself to
Shamū`ål in Shalah by The Word of Yahūah/‫יהוה‬.
Shamūʿål Ålaph /1Sam 16:7 But Yahūah/‫ יהוה‬said unto Shamūʿål, Look not on his countenance, or on the
height of his stature; because I have refused him: for not as man sees; for man looks on the outward
appearance, but Yahūah/‫ יהוה‬looks on the heart.
Malakým Býṭh/2Kgs 9:26 “Surely I have seen yesterday the blood of Nabūṭh, and the blood of his sons, saith
Yahūah/‫ ;יהוה‬and I will requite thee in this plat, saith Yahūah/‫יהוה‬. Now therefore take and cast him into the
plat of ground, according to The Word of Yahūah/‫יהוה‬.”
Malakým Býṭh/1Kgs 17:14 For thus saith Yahūah/‫ יהוה‬Ålahý/‫( אלהי‬Mighty Ones) of Yasharʿål, “The barrel of
meal shall not waste, neither shall the cruse of oil fail, until the day that Yahūah/‫ יהוה‬sends rain upon the
earth.”
Malakým Býṭh/2Kgs 20:5 “Turn again, and tell CḥazaqYahū the captain of my people, “Thus says Yahūah/‫יהוה‬,
Ålahý/‫( אלהי‬Mighty Ones) of Dūd your father, I have heard your prayer, I have seen your tears: behold, I will
heal you: on the third day you shall go up to The House of Yahūah/‫יהוה‬.”
YaramYahū/Jer 14:10 Thus saith Yahūah/‫ יהוה‬unto this people, “They loved to wander, they have not refrained
their feet, therefore Yahūah/‫ יהוה‬doth not accept them; he will now remember their iniquity, and visit their
sins.
YaramYahū/Jer 26:2 Thus saith Yahūah/‫יהוה‬, “Stand in the court of Yahūah/‫ יהוה‬House, and speak unto all the
cities of Yahūdah, which come to worship in Yahūah/‫ יהוה‬House, all The Words that I Command you to speak
to them; diminish not a word…”
YaramYahū/Jer 31:38 Behold, the days come, saith Yahūah/‫יהוה‬, that the city shall be built to Yahūah/‫יהוה‬
from the tower of Cḥanan`ål unto the gate of the corner.
YaramYahū/Jer 33:2 Thus saith Yahūah/‫ יהוה‬the maker thereof, Yahūah/‫ יהוה‬that formed it, to establish it;
Yahūah/‫ יהוה‬is His Name…”
YaramYahū/Jer 34:12 Therefore, The Word of Yahūah/‫ יהוה‬came to YaramYahū from Yahūah/‫יהוה‬, saying…”
Yacḥazaq`ål/Ezek 44:5 And Yahūah/‫ יהוה‬said unto me, Son of man, mark well, and behold with thine eyes, and
hear with thine ears all that I say unto thee concerning all The Ordinances of The House of Yahūah/‫יהוה‬, and all
The Laws thereof; and mark well the entering in of The House, with every going forth of The Sanctuary.
Hūshâ/Hos 1:2 The beginning of The Word of Yahūah/‫ יהוה‬by Hūshâ. And Yahūah/‫ יהוה‬said to Hūshâ, “Go,
take yourself a woman of whoring and children of whoring, for the land has utterly whored away from
Yahūah/‫יהוה‬.”
Hūshâ/Hos 3:1 Then Yahūah/‫ יהוה‬said to me, “Go again, love a woman loved by a friend, and an adulteress,
according to The Love of Yahūah/‫ יהוה‬for the children of Yasharʿål, though they are turning to other mighty
ones and love their raisin cakes.”
                                                                                                           Page 142 of 396

        Âmūs/Amos 2:4 Thus said Yahūah/‫יהוה‬, “For three transgressions of Yahūdah, and for four, I do not turn it
        back, because they have rejected the Ṭūrah of Yahūah/‫יהוה‬, and did not guard His Laws. And their lies after
        which their fathers walked lead them astray.
        Âmūs/Amos 8:11 “See, days are coming,” declares the Master Yahūah/‫יהוה‬, “that I shall send a hunger in the
        land, not a hunger for bread, nor a thirst for water, but for hearing The Word of Yahūah/‫יהוה‬.
        ZakarYah/Zech 3:2 And Yahūah/‫ יהוה‬said to Shatan, (adversary) “Yahūah/‫ יהוה‬rebuke you, Shatan!
        Yahūah/‫ יהוה‬who has chosen Yarūshalam rebuke you! Is this not a brand plucked from the fire?”
        ZakarYah/Zech 6:12 “…and shall speak to him, saying, ‘Thus said Yahūah/‫ יהוה‬Tsabʿåŭṭh, saying, “See, the Man
        whose Name is The Branch! And from His place He shall branch out, and He shall build the Hýkal of
        Yahūah/‫יהוה‬.
        ZakarYah/Zech 10:12 “And I shall strengthen them in Yahūah/‫יהוה‬, so that they walk up and down in His
        Name,” declares Yahūah/‫יהוה‬.
        ZakarYah/Zech 14:9 And Yahūah/‫ יהוה‬shall be Sovereign over all the earth. In that day there shall be only
        Yahūah/‫יהוה‬, and His Name only. (The Word is always speaking about His Father to man.)

                                       The Father and His Word: Ålahým
                                              Yahūah and Yahūshâ
   The Word of Yahūah has been The Salvation of His people, since The Word was given. Do the Command, and The
                  Command will save you! Love The Command, and it will circumcise your heart!



          Hear O Yasharʿål: Yahūah our Ålahým; Yahūah is ‫אחד‬/One? (Dabarým/Deut 6:4). Let’s look at this.
To hear what Yahūah is declaring, is to first choose a heart that will give in to what He is saying to us, through these
Commands. The Hebrew word for hear is the H8085, ‫שמע‬. I have currently been doing a study on this word, and its
contextual use throughout the scriptures with a brother who has many years of etymological, and in-depth research on
linguistics regarding this subject matter. The results of his research amazed me. I was shocked at what he uncovered. Let
me first urge you students to seek out this study on the word hear or shmâ. Without a heart to hear/obey, you will never
understand what Yahūah is saying. Obeying is the act of hearing or listening. Let’s see how studying the act of obeying
or listening, can reveal unexpected treasures to the first time student of the scriptures.

If you recall in Shamūʿål Ålaph/1Sam 8:4-7, Yahūah is not pleased with His people, because they want a king. Why? The
rest of the nations were doing this. So, what was the problem? Why didn’t Yahūah want His people to set up their rule,
with a man for a king? It is clear Yahūah is offended at this whole idea (Shamūʿål Ålaph/1Sam 12:17-25). I want to review
the time where Mashah received the Laws of Yahūah. But before I do, I want to take a look at the word åcḥad/‫אחד‬,
which is the target word in the scripture above in red, translated as the number one (1) in the English; or so we have been
led to believe.

From the BDB:
Original: ‫אחד‬
- Transliteration: åcḥad
- Phonetic: ach-awd

e. only, once, once for all
f. one...another, the one...the other, one after another, one by one
g. first

2 only one person came: a single, a solitary, a sole, a lone.
3 her one concern was her daughter: "only", single, solitary, sole, exclusive.

As I began to realize what this brother had uncovered, I started to understand that this passage of scripture could not be
translated in its traditional form contextually. Why? Because, Yahūah has consistently told His people and declared over
and over again, to listen or obey; heed or hear, His word and His word only. So, what does this have to do with what
happened in Shamūʿål chapter 8, and what happened on the mountain? Well let’s go to Dabarým/Deut 5:23-29 and find
out.

Dabarým 5:23 “And  it came to be, when you heard the Voice from the midst of the darkness, while the mountain was
burning with fire, that you came near to me, all the heads of your tribes and your elders,
Dabarým 5:24 andsaid, ‘See, ‫ יהוה‬our Ålahým has shown us His esteem and His greatness, and we have heard His Voice
from the midst of the fire. Today we have seen that Ålahým speaks with man – and he lives!
Dabarým 5:25 ‘And  now why should we die? For this great fire is consuming us. If we hear The Voice of ‫ יהוה‬our Ålahým
any more, then we shall die. Compare: Shamūṭh/Ex 20:19- they did not want to hear from Yahūah, but from Mashah.
Dabarým 5:26 ‘For who is there of all flesh who has heard The Voice of The Living Ålahým speaking from the midst of the
fire, as we have, and does live?
Dabarým 5:27 ‘Yougo near and hear all that ‫ יהוה‬our Ålahým says, and speak to us all that ‫ יהוה‬our Ålahým says to you,
and we shall hear and do it.’
Dabarým 5:28 “And  ‫ יהוה‬heard the voice of your words when you spoke to me, and ‫ יהוה‬said to me, ‘I have heard the voice
of the words of this people which they have spoken to you. They have done well in all that they have spoken.
Dabarým 5:29 ‘Oh, that they had such a heart in them, to fear Me and to guard all My Commands always, so that it might be
well with them and with their children forever!

I want to share with you what this brother shared with me about verse 28:
         “If you are reading it in the Åbarý (Hebrew) correctly, applying the rules that they have put in place
 [e.g. the ha (‫) ה‬prefixed at the beginning of the statement], you will see a different picture being painted. Yahūah is
  actually asking if they have done well in all that they spoke, which is why the next sentence He says, ‘If only they
                                had a heart to fear Me and guard all My Commands…’”

Now, look at what The Most High is actually trying to convey. The heart of Yahūah wanted those people to hear and
listen or have the heart to obey His Commands...listening to Him directly was part of those Commands! In other words,
He would not have given the people a statement of disappointment had they spoken well. This is an excellent point. What
does Shamūʿål chapter 8 have to do with this? Yahūah was upset because the people wanted to have a man as sovereign,
and not Him. They did not have a heart to want to listen to Yahūah directly. They wanted to listen to a man instead. Just
like the situation that occurred on the mountain. It is clear in verse 28 of Dabarým, that Yahūah was upset here as well.
The people did not do well; by not wanting to listen to Yahūah. This brother continues to explain:

“When considering all the places He directed them to shmâ/‫( שמע‬listen) His Voice and applying the rules of Åbarý
(Hebrew) grammar; as well as keeping the context of what He has said from the beginning, we can see something very
different here. His question leaves one to wonder if they had done right by desiring to shmâ/‫( שמע‬listen) to Mashah, as
                                                                                                                      Page 144 of 396

opposed to listening to His Voice directly as He spoke to them. Suggesting this notion is extremely controversial in many
ideologies. But, has ideology esteemed man over Yahūah?” –“Turn Back! But How?” by Mal`akYahu p. 35

Now, let us translate Dabarým/Deut 6:4 in context with what Yahūah is saying to His people with regards to hearing.
                  Hear O Yasharʿål: Yahūah our Ålahým; Yahūah only! (Compare: ZakarYah/Zech 14:9)
Using Dabarým/Deut 6:4 as an argument against The view of Ålahým as two beings (The Father and The Word) rather
than one, is like putting a milk bucket under a bull. It just does not fit when reading the passage in context. This passage is
telling Yasharʿål to listen to His Voice only. Now, what about these passages:

Dabarým/Deut 32:39 ‘See now that I, I am He, And there is no Ålahým besides Me. I put to death and I make alive. I have wounded,
and I heal. And from My hand no one delivers! There is no other mighty ones’s voice to listen to.

YashâYahū/Isa 44:8 ‘Do
                    not fear, nor be afraid. Have I not since made you hear, and declared it? You are My witnesses. Is there an
Ålūah besides Me? There is no other Rock, I know not one.’ ” There is no other single mighty ones’s voice to listen to.

YashâYahū/Isa 45:5 ‘I   am ‫יהוה‬, and there is none else – there is no Ålahým besides Me. I gird you, though you have not known Me.

YashâYahū/Isa 45:21 “Declare    and bring near, let them even take counsel together. Who has announced this from of old? Who has
declared it from that time? Is it not I, ‫ ?יהוה‬And there is no mighty one besides Me, a Righteous Ål and a Savior, there is none
besides Me. The Father is a Mighty One. His Word is a Savior.


MaṭhaṭhYahū/Matt 27:46 And about the ninth hour ‫ יהושע‬cried out with a loud voice, saying, “Ěli, Ěli, lemah shebaqtani?” that is, “My
Ål, My Ål, why have You forsaken Me?” “My Mighty One, (Father) Why have you forsaken me?”

Yahūcḥanan/Jn 8:54 ‫יהושע‬ answered, “If I esteem Myself, My esteem is none at all. It is My Father who esteems Me, of whom you say
that He is your Ålahým. They have no understanding of “Alahym” because they are rejecting the Word in the flesh.


Yahūcḥanan/Jn 20:17 ‫יהושע‬  said to her, “Do not hold on to Me, for I have not yet ascended to My Father. But go to My brothers and
say to them, ‘I am ascending to My Father and your Father, and to My Ålahým and your Ålahým.’ ”

If there is none beside Him, then how do we explain the Mashýacḥ; one who is worshipped (Yahūcḥanan/Jn 20:28), while
calling on His Father to “let this cup pass from me” during His anguish in the garden (MaṭhaṭhYahū/Matt 26:39)? I want to
look at Ålūah. The BDB gives it this definition:
Ålūah/‫ אלוה‬from H433 (god) and comes from the H430: Ål/‫ אל‬meaning mighty one.

To translate anything and everything relating to Ål or Ålahým as “God” is reckless. God has a specific meaning and a
specific usage in the text. This is explained in section four. Now, about Yahūcḥanan/Jn 20:17; if Yahūshâ is speaking
about His Father, it becomes clear after careful study, that the translation should read; “my mighty one”, and not “my
Ålahým’ (Yahūcḥanan 8:42). Remember also, Ålahým has replaced The Name of “Yahūah” in many places within the text.
When Yahūah said, there is none beside me, that was Ålahým pleading with His people. The Word is sent forth from The
Father (Shamūṭh 15:7; Shamūʿål Býṭh 22:14; Ṭahalým18:13; YashâYahū 55:11; Yahūcḥanan 8:42, 17:8; Luke 12:49, 50). This
means they (Yasharʿål) have no other teacher but The Word sent from The Father (Matt 23:8). There is no other mighty
one to hear but Him only (Dabarým 5:24; 6:4). The Word speaks The Fathers Words. There is only one place where truth
and life comes from, and that is The Mouth of The Father. Yahūshâ said He was The Truth and The Life (Yahūcḥanan
14:6). The Word has always been their savior. The Word has always been their leader, their defender, their teacher (Åýūb
36:22; Ṭahalým 25:4; 84:5, 6; 119:26, 99; YashâYahū 30:20-28; Yahūʿål 2:23; MaṭhaṭhYahū 23:8), sent by The Father (Matt
23:8-12). In addition, The Word of Yahūah has all too often, been rejected by His people. This is why they could not wait
to kill Him when they saw the fullness of the Ṭūrah face to face. The Word of Yahūah prepares men’s hearts to be worthy
of The Fathers presence. The Word only does what The Father instructs (Yahūcḥanan 5:19, 8:28 12:49).Without this
intensive, long and drawn out plan of preparation from The Word He sent to us, all of us would be destroyed. Yet, only a
few will walk this path (MaṭhaṭhYahū 7:13, 14).

         Shamūʿål Ålaph/1Sam 1:11 And she made a vow and said, “ Yahūah/‫ יהוה‬Tsabʿåŭṭh/‫צבאות‬, (army of
         resources”) You would indeed look on the affliction of your female servant and remember me, and not forget
         your female servant, but shall give your female servant a male child, then I shall give him to Yahūah/‫ יהוה‬all the
         days of his life, and let no razor come upon his head.”
         Shamūʿål Ålaph/1Sam 4:4 And the people sent to Shalah, and they brought from there the ark of the covenant
         of Yahūah/‫ יהוה‬Tsabʿåŭṭh/‫( צבאות‬army of resources), dwelling between the karabým. And the two sons of Âlý,
         Cḥaphaný and Pýnacḥas, were there with the ark of the covenant of Ålahým.
         Shamūʿål Ålaph/1Sam 15:2“Thus said Yahūah/‫ יהוה‬Tsabʿåŭṭh/‫( צבאות‬army of resources), ‘I shall punish
         Âmalaq for what he did to Yashar`ål, how he set himself against him on the way when he came up from
         Matsarým.
         Shamūʿål Ålaph/1Sam 17:45 But Dūd said to the Palashaṭhý, “You come to me with a sword, and with a spear,
         and with a javelin. But I come to you in The Name of Yahūah/‫ יהוה‬Tsabʿåŭṭh/‫( צבאות‬army of resources), the
         Ålahým of the armies of Yashar`ål, whom you have reproached.
         Shamūʿål Ålaph/2Sam 5:10 Dūd became great, and Yahūah/‫ יהוה‬Ålahým Tsabʿåŭṭh/‫( צבאות‬army of resources)
         was with him.
         Shamūʿål Ålaph/2Sam 6:2 And Dūd rose up and went with all the people who were with him from B῾âlý
         Yahūdah, to bring up from there the ark of Ålahým, that is called by The Name, The Name Yahūah/‫יהוה‬
         Tsabʿåŭṭh/‫( צבאות‬army of resources), who dwells between the karabým.
         Mal`åký/Mal 1:14 But cursed be the deceiver, which hath in his flock a male, and vowed, and sacrificed to
         Ådaný (My Master) a corrupt thing: for I am a great King, saith Yahūah/‫ יהוה‬Tsabʿåŭṭh/‫( צבאות‬army of
         resources). My Name is dreadful among the heathen.
         Malakým Býṭh/2Kgs 3:14 And ÅlYashâ said, “As Yahūah/‫ יהוה‬Tsabʿåŭṭh/‫( צבאות‬army of resources) lives, before
         whom I stand, if it were not that I regard the presence of Yahūshaphat sovereign of Yehūdah, I would not look
         at you nor see you.
         Ṭahalým/Ps 46:7 Yahūah/‫ יהוה‬Tsabʿåŭṭh/‫( צבאות‬army of resources) is with us; The Ålahým of Y῾âqb is our
         refuge. Salah. (In the “Aleppo” and the “Westminster Leningrad Codex” this passage is numbered as verse 8)
         Ṭahalým/Ps 48:8 As we have heard, so we have seen In the city of Yahūah/‫ יהוה‬Tsabʿåŭṭh/‫( צבאות‬army of
         resources), In the city of *Ålahýnū/‫( אלהינו‬our Ålahým), Ålahým establishes her forever. Selah. (In the “Aleppo”
         and the “Westminster Leningrad Codex” this passage is numbered as verse 9)
         YashâYahū/Isa 1:9 Unless Yahūah/‫ יהוה‬Tsabʿåŭṭh/‫( צבאות‬army of resources) had left to us a small remnant, we
         would have become like Sadam, we would have been made like Âmarah.
         YaramYahū/Jer 8:3 “And death shall be preferred to life by all the rest of those who remain of this evil people,
         who remain in all the places where I have driven them,” declares Yahūah/‫ יהוה‬Tsabʿåŭṭh/‫( צבאות‬army of
         resources).
         Âmūs/Amos 3:13 “Hear and witness against the house of Y`âqb,” declares the Master *Yahūah/‫ יהוה‬, the
         Ålahým of Tsabʿåŭṭh/‫( צבאות‬army of resources).

 *Ålahýnū/‫( אלהינו‬our Ålahým) – is an example of a conjugated form of Ålahým/‫( – אלהים‬see p. 132) Their, our, my, his, are used to
translate the standard used which is Ålahým: his Ålahým, our Ålahým etc. I rarely use the conjugated forms in section 3.

Section 4: Chap 1




This section lists the many ways Bʿâl/‫ בעל‬is used in the scriptures. It is transliterated as “Baal”, and means possessor or
“LORD.” The meaning of the name of Bʿâl/‫ בעל‬is used as a replacement for The Name of The Father, Yahūah/ ‫יהוה‬. I
have collected all of the uses of this name or title of Bʿâl/‫ בעל‬as I could find with “Strong’s” numbers and their
definitions. On page 34, it is explained that names are transliterated preserving the sound of the letters as they are
written. The next step is to transfer these sounds into the target language from its source language. This fundamental rule
has been grossly violated, and has since become common practice by the scribes between the fifth and eighth century.
This same practice has been followed by a plethora of scholars, it has been embedded into all our study materials, and
now the layperson of every belief system in the earth today has been misled to follow suit. Needless to say, this list should
give anyone a fair supply of ammunition to tell the difference between the four letter Name of Yahūah/ ‫ יהוה‬and the three
letter name of Bʿâl/‫בעל‬.

Key:
All definitions in this list are taken from the “Brown-Driver-Briggs Hebrew and English Lexicon” in “The Word” Software.
I put a line through any word taken from the “BDB” transliterated incorrectly with the correct spelling following it. Example: Baal/Bʿâl
“The “KJV” translates “Strong’s” H--- in the following manner” is taken from “blueletterbible.com” throughout this entire list.
(Total --x) is how many times the word in question is used in the scriptures.
Refer to “Diacritic Chart” on p. 8 for pronunciation assistance of transliterated Hebrew words.

                                      Yahūah/‫ יהוה‬has something to say about THE LORD:
  YaramYahū/Jer 23:25-27 25 “I have heard what the nabýʿåým said, that fortell lies in My Name, saying, I have dreamed, I have
dreamed. 26 How long shall [this] be in the heart of the nabýå that fortell lies? Yes, [they are] nabýå of the deceit of their own heart;
 27 Which think to cause My people to forget My Name by their dreams which they tell every man to his neighbor, as their fathers

                                               have forgotten ‫ את‬My Name for Bʿâl/ ‫בעל‬.

        Ṭahalým/Ps 24:1 The earth belongs to ‫יהוה‬, and all that fills it – The world and those who dwell in it.

The psalmist does not replace His Name with Bʿâl, nor should we. His Name is clearly seen in the Hebrew. Replacing
His Name with another or replacing His Name with a title, is not how we were instructed to guard His Name. This means
He is a lord (possessor). He possesses the earth and all that is in it. But, His Name is Yahūah, not Lord.

YaramYahū/Jer 23:26, 27 “Till when shall it be in the heart of the Nabýʿå? – the Nabýʿåým of falsehood and Nabýʿåým
of the deceit of their own heart 27who try to make My people forget My Name by their dreams which everyone relates to
his neighbor, as their fathers forgot My Name for Bʿâl.” (Lord)

Section 4: Chap 1a

  Now, let’s look at a passage that is deceptive. Keep an eye open to the reference numbers, and their origins as well as
         error entries, to the “Brown - Driver - Briggs Hebrew and English Lexicon”. Can you spot all of them?

                                Here are two passages of scripture without “Strong’s” reference numbers.
NET:
1Tim 6:14 “...to  obey this command without fault or failure until the appearing of our Lord Jesus Christ.”
1Tim 6:15 –   “...whose appearing the blessed and only Sovereign, the King of kings and Lord of lords, will reveal at the right time.”

                                   Here are the same two scriptures with “Strong’s” reference numbers.
                                              Can you identify the twists in the English translation?
KJV:
 1Tim 6:14 That      thou G4571 keep G5083 this commandment G1785 without spot G784, unrebukeable G423, until G3360 the appearing

Section 4: Chap 2

As stated in the previous section, the fundamental rule of transliterating our Creators Name from Hebrew to English has
been grossly violated. Lord, is not the only ploy used to cover or replace His Name. God is another name, or title, that
has been thrown into the mix of replacements for The Name of Yahūah/‫יהוה‬. With only four different Hebrew reference
numbers, making my job less laborious, and identified by two Hebrew characters, I have copied and pasted this
information for the new student, who may not have access to study materials. Reading over this list, I don’t imagine,
would be too agonizing to tell the difference between The Name of Yahūah/‫ יהוה‬and God/Gad/G-D/‫גד‬.

Key:
All definitions in this list are taken from the “Brown-Driver-Briggs Hebrew and English Lexicon” in The Word Software.
I put a line through any word taken from the BDB transliterated incorrectly with the correct spelling following it. Example: Jacob/Yʿâqb
“The KJV translates “Strong’s” H--- in the following manner” is taken from “blueletterbible.com” throughout this entire list
(Total --x) is how many times the word is used in the scriptures.
Refer to “Diacritic Chart” on p. 8 for pronunciation assistance of transliterated Hebrew words.


                                          Yahūah/‫ יהוה‬has something to say about God:
     YashâYahū/Isa 65:11 “But you are those who forsake ‫יהוה‬, who forget My Set-Apart Mountain, who prepare a table for
                                          H1409
                                                  Gad/‫גד‬, and who fill a drink offering for Mný.”
H1407 -     ‫גד‬     coriander: a plant the seed of which resembles manna The KJV translates “Strong’s” H1407 in the following manner:
coriander (2x).
H1408 - ‫ גד‬god of fortune; Babylonian deity; (variation of H1409) The KJV translates “Strong’s” H1408 in the following manner: non translated
variant (1x).
H1409 - ‫ גד‬originates from the (                fortune; good fortune) The KJV translates “Strong’s” H1409 in the following manner: troop (2x).
H1410 - ‫ גד‬originates from the (                fortune; good fortune) The KJV translates “Strong’s” H1410 in the following manner: Gad (70x).


                                                Looking further into the reference numbers:
H1407 ‫ גד‬Definition: 1. coriander - a plant the seed of which resembles manna - Origin: from H1413 (in the sense of
         - -
cutting)
                    H1413: ‫( גדד‬ga - dawd) 1. to penetrate, cut, attack, invade - Origin: a primitive root [compare                ]

                          :   ‫( גוד‬ga - dood)    - Definition: 1. to invade, attack   - Origin: a primitive root [akin to H1413]


H1408-‫ גד‬-Definition: Gad = "god of fortune" 1. a Babylonian deity - Origin: a variation of H1409
H1409-‫ גד‬-Definition: 1. fortune, good fortune - Origin: from     (in the sense of distributing)
                      H1464: 1. to invade, attack - Origin: a primitive root [akin to H1413]
H1410    -‫ גד‬-Definition: Gad = "troop"         1. seventh son of Jacob/Yʿâqb by Zilpah/zalphah, Leah's/Låʿah handmaid, and full brother
of Asher/Åshr.

2. the tribe descended from Gad 3. a prophet during the time of David/Dūýd; appears to have joined David/Dūýd when in the hold;
reappears in connection with the punishment for taking a census; also assisted in the arrangements for the musical service of the
"House of God/Alahým" - Origin: from          H1464: 1. to invade, attack - Origin: a primitive root [akin to H1413]

                                        Here’s a shocker! God is not ‫ יהוה‬and ‫ יהוה‬is not God!
                A challenge for the student: find one Hebrew passage of scripture where ‫ יהוה‬refers to Himself as ‫גד‬.
                    It would look like this in the Hebrew: ‫ אני גד‬or ‫ – שמי גד‬meaning: “I am god” or “My name, god”

The above passage is well known, and even children in Christian circles know of it. The English translation of the above
            passage is called the target language. It says that God is the creator of heaven and the earth.
                  Below, I have inserted the same passage in Hebrew. This is the source language.
                      I have included the reference numbers to assist you in solving the riddle.

 The only way to win this game is to not find any matches, at all. If God and LORD cannot be found where we were led to
believe they were; in the source language, then why are they present in the target language to begin with? That my friend,
  is the mother of all questions. If we can find this deliberate deception over and over again in the Old Testament, then
          wouldn’t it stand to reason to continue to check the scribes and translators in the “New Testament”?

Section 4: Chap 3

The online “Wikipedia” states: in theism God is sometimes called Theos. The online Etymology Dictionary says that theo
is a word-forming element meaning "god, gods, God," of Greek theos "god.” God is used in the New Testament that is
translated from the Greek word “Theos”, typically for the Hebrew word “Ålahým”

Theos (θεός) Greek for “God” is the G2316 and occurs 1,343 times
The KJV translates “Strong’s” G2316 in the following manner: God (1,320x), god (13x), godly (3x), God-
ward (with G4214) (2x), misc (5x).

Kurios (κύριος) is a Greek word translating to "lord, master"; the Biblical Hebrew title "my lord" given to ‫יהוה‬.
Kurios (κύριος) Greek for "Lord" is the G2962 and occurs 748 times
The KJV translates “Strong’s” G2962 in the following manner: Lord (667x), lord (54x), master (11x), sir (6x), Sir (6x),
misc (4x).
            Whenever the OT (Old Testament) is quoted, the Greek “Kurios” for Lord is used in place of Yahūah/‫יהוה‬.

There are many scholars who contend with one another’s research regarding the authenticity of The Name ‫ יהוה‬in Greek NT
manuscripts; whether preserved in Paleo, found in Greek writings, or in the Hebrew/Aramaic script. One researcher will put out a
journal of a persuasive argument showing a clear indication that The Name in question, was replaced with surrogates from Greek NT
manuscripts. Then, immediately following his research, one of his peers will publish a research paper stating that The Name ‫יהוה‬
wasn’t replaced in the Greek manuscripts. Because it was not there at all after the second century. So any NT Greek manuscript, with
The Name ‫יהוה‬, after that time period lacks authenticity, because it would prove to be a copy of the original. Which then, leaves for
strong speculation that The Name could have been written in by the scribes, and not the original writers of the text.

In all my research on this one subject alone, I have found that every scholar’s journal, research paper, and online forum blog I have
personally read myself: from pastors, to teachers and laypersons, can all agree; that there is no conclusive evidence that the original
writers of the NT (New Testament) used surrogates (substitutes) to replace The Name ‫יהוה‬. It can also be agreed on, that Kyrios is
written in by the scribes as a substitute for This Name, ‫יהוה‬. This is a fact. No one argues this point which is the soul purpose of this
book. It makes no difference whether NT Greek manuscripts are copies or not. It makes no difference if there is any authentic
documentation left in the earth at all that proves The Name ‫ יהוה‬can be seen in a Greek NT manuscript in Paleo, or in the Hebrew
script, or what specific century the authenticity of the text ceased to be an original. I say this for one reason- The Written Word, NT
writers quoting OT passages, with The Name ‫ יהוה‬found in the quoted text. That alone is the strongest evidence anyone can produce in
proving The Name, ‫יהוה‬, to be as authentic, in a corrected translation, as the original Greek manuscript itself. If the writers are
quoting His Name, then there is no need for a surrogate argument, nor is there a need for the original document. A copy will do just
fine, thank you.
                                               It is evident that The Name of Yahūah has been removed or replaced in the English translation of
                                               the Old Testament. Evidence also shows The Name has been removed and or changed/corrupted
                                               in the New Testament as well. While considering the research of scholar George Howard, can
                                               God/theos or Lord/kurios replace the 4 letter Name of Yahūah/‫ יהוה‬spoken of by The Creator,
                                               without transgression, according to the written commandment found in the Hebrew text:
                                               Shamūṭh/Exod 20:7 - “You shall not lift up (speak) ‫ את‬The Name of ‫ יהוה‬your Ålahým to
                                               ruin it, for ‫ את יהוה‬will not acquit (pardon) anyone who lifts up (speaks) ‫ את‬His Name to
                                               ruin it.

  thought were significant in his findings on “Kurios” and “Theos”. Enjoy the screen captures on the following pages.

                                                   I can see clearly now…

                                      Yahūshâ/‫ יהושע‬is a five (5) letter name
                                       Yahūah/‫ יהוה‬is a four (4) letter name
                                         B`âl/‫ בעל‬is a three (3) letter name
                                           God/‫ גד‬is a two (2) letter name
                                          Theos/θεός is cognate with God
                     Kurios/κύριος is where LORD is derived; LORD is cognate with B`âl/‫בעל‬
   Notice how B`âl, God, Theos, and Kurios are all family in origin? Yahūah and Yahūshâ stick out, all by themselves.

Section 4: Chap 4
                                                                    “as it is written”
  This section investigates the title Ålahým, The Name of Yahūah and The Name of Yahūshâ, in the New Testament. The
  quotes that read, “as it is written”, are notorious for changing The Name in the quote originating from OT passages.
                                          Let’s see what evidence can be found here.

                 Whenever OT passages are quoted with ‫אלהים‬, ‫יהוה‬, or ‫ יהושע‬the translator uses:


Kurios (κύριος) --- “LORD” for ‫יהוה‬/Yahūah
Iesoūs (Ἰησοῦς) --- “Jesus” for ‫יהושע‬/Yahūshâ
Theos (θεός) -------- “God” for ‫אלהים‬/Ålahým


                                             Observe:
      MaṭhaṭhYahū/Matt 4:7 *Yahūshâ quotes Dabarým/Deut 6:16. The name found there is, "                 ‫יהוה‬
       *‫( אלהיכם‬Yahūah your Ålahým a conjugated form)."         Let’s pull the English translation back, and see what’s
       under there…



                               From English standard version- MaṭhaṭhYahū/Matt 4:7
       *Yahūshâ/Jesus said to him, “Again it is written, ‘You shall not put the Lord your God to the test.’”


                                  Quote originates from: Dabarým/Deut 6:16
             Deut 6:16 “Do not test Yahūah/‫ יהוה‬your Ålahým/‫ אלהים‬as you tried Him in Masah.



                                      Greek rendering of Yahūah and Ålahým:
                                               κυριον τον θεον σου

                               ‫יהוה‬H3068 = kurios (κύριος) Greek for "Lord." G2962
                                ‫אלהים‬H430 = Theos (θεός) Greek for “God” G2316

                              From New English Translation - MaṭhaṭhYahū/Matt 4:4
  Matt 4:4 But he answered, “It is written, ‘Man does not live by bread alone, but by every word that comes
                                         from the mouth of *God.’”

         MaṭhaṭhYahū/Matt 21:42 *Yahūshâ quoted Ṭahalým/Ps 118:22-23. The name found underneath the
                 English translation in this passage is, "‫( "יהוה‬Yahūah). Let’s see what’s hidden…



                             From English standard version- MaṭhaṭhYahū/Matt 21:42
    Matt 21:42 *Yahūshâ/Jesus said to them, “Have you never read in the scriptures: ‘The stone the builders
         rejected has become the cornerstone. This is from the Lord, and it is marvelous in our eyes’?

 Here is another challenge for the student. Transliterate this Greek name, Ἰησοῦς into the English. Check for differences
        between this transliteration and that of the H3091. A Greek letter chart can be found on page 11 and 392.

 The information in the previous passages I hope, will encourage you to continue; to seek out The Name of Yahūah, ‘to see if these
 thing are so’; proving the foretelling of The Name of The Mashýacḥ. The remaining portion of this section consists of a list of NT
 quotes originating from the OT in a three column chart. Please note that I have not collected every passage on this subject. As you
study the scriptures, or read through the accounts of Yahūshâ at your leisure, common errors will become more and more obvious to
  you. The first column to the left are passages found in the NT, that quote or refer to a name in the OT. The middle column is the
Hebrew text the quote originates from in the OT passage. The last and third column at the right, is the quote in the English translation
            from the OT, that the NT writer is quoting. Compare the columns from left to right as directed by the arrows.

According to Yahūʿål/Joel 2:32, The Name to call on for Salvation, is Yahūah/‫יהוה‬. Yahūshâ said, “So also you have
sorrow now, but I will see you again, and your hearts will rejoice, and no one will take your joy away from you. 23At that time you
will ask me nothing. I tell you the solemn truth, whatever you ask the Father in My Name He will give you. 24Until now you have not
asked for anything in My Name. Ask and you will receive it, so that your joy may be complete. 25I have told you these things in
obscure figures of speech; a time is coming when I will no longer speak to you in obscure figures, but will tell you plainly about the
Father. 26At that time you will ask in My Name, and I do not say that I will ask the Father on your behalf. Yahūcḥanan 16: 22-26

                                                             He also said,
Believe me that I am in The Father, and The Father is in Me, but if you do not believe me, believe because of the miraculous deeds
themselves. 12I tell you the solemn truth, the person who believes in Me will perform the miraculous deeds that I am doing, and will
perform greater deeds than these, because I am going to The Father. 13And I will do whatever you ask in My Name, so that The
Father may be Esteemed in The Son. 14If you ask anything in My Name, I will do it. Yahūcḥanan 14: 11-14

We make our requests known to The Father, in The Name of Yahūshâ. When we call on The Name of Yahūah, He
always sends us Yahūshâ. Yahūshâ does the work! Yahūshâ is The Word/Law/Ṭūrah/Right-Rulings spoken from the
mouth of The Father. The only way we can be a friend of Yahūshâ, is to turn our hearts toward these commands that
came out of the mouth of His Father, Yahūah. This is why Yahūshâ said, “You are My Friends if you do what I command
you.” Yahūcḥanan 15:14

This is how to be friends with Ṭūrah, and all the Right-Rulings. If we turn a deaf ear to the Ṭūrah/Commands, our prayers
will be an abomination to Yahūah; even if we do ask Him for something in The Name of Yahūshâ.

The one who turns away his ear from hearing the law, even his prayer is an abomination. Mashalý 28:9 (Mashalý15:8, 29, 21:27;
Tahalým 66:18; YashâYahū 59:2; Yahūcḥanan 9:31; James 4:3)

         SECTION 4: Chap 5


                                       Evidence for the Name ‫יהוה‬



The following is a list of the witnesses (Acts 10:43, Dabarým/Deut 19:15, MaṭhaṭhYahū/Matt 18:16, Yahūcḥanan/Jn 8: 17-18) who testify to
The Name of Yahūah The Father (‫ )יהוה‬and His Son Yahūshâ (‫)יהושע‬. The Name of The Son testifies of The Name of The Father.
Who considers this? The names of these witnesses contain a portion of The Father’s Name, that aids us in pronouncing the first 3
letters of His Name (Shamūṭh/Ex 3:15) when read in the Hebrew text. These Hebrew names have been misspelled through a poor
Yiddish transliteration. As a result, our Creators Name, and the pronunciation, has been concealed when looking at the Yiddish forms
of these names. With this evidence exposed we can see beyond all reasonable doubt; what has been hidden from us for centuries.
Truth about The Name now, has become so obvious, so redundantly clear, that the only thing preventing us from knowing The Fathers
Name, and The Name of His Son, with the correct pronunciation; will be our own arrogance and rebellion.

Page Navigation:

The Top left of the page will list the corrected form of the Hebrew name in English. Next to its right side will be the same name in the
Hebrew/Aramaic script. To the far right, will be the same name in its incorrect form, as we have been taught to view it: the ruined
form – Yiddish. Each of these names who testify reveals the hidden “Yah” and “Yahoo” portions of The Father’s Name which better
aid us in transliteration and pronunciation. These “portions” will be underlined. Example: ‫עשיה – אדניהו‬

Underneath the name, will be its Hebrew reference number, where you can easily see its definition. This will include the ref# of
H3050. Notice that this particular number H3050 (from H3068), carries the eternal characteristic of the Father, and shows up in every
one of these names. The Exception: when the root is not listed, yet the Yahu is clearly visible in the name such as: Yahūdah, Yahūdý
and Yahūdýṭh. There will be other reference numbers in its definition. Studying these roots, is an important part of searching out The
Name.

While Looking up these “Strong’s” reference numbers, I want to bring to your attention the changes I have made in the listed
definitions. The “Strong’s” will frequently replace the Y in “Yah” with the letter J; even though it is apparent in the first
pronunciation, to the far right of the number, that the letter J and the J sound is misleading. I corrected this error, along with any
“Jahovah” transliterations, which referenced The Name of The Father. The blue box, found in the top right hand corner of each page,
will have “jah” replaced with “Yah”. The remaining J’s are left intentionally for observation. A review of the “Hebrew Ålaph Býṭh”
page of this book (p. 10) is recommended to better understand the individual sounds the Hebrew letters carry.

The blue box also emphasizes the H3050 for obvious reasons: it is a portion of the full name from this reference number H3068
meaning, Self-Existence (to exist; primary characteristic of Yahūah). The H3068 has the H1961 assigned to it. It is suggested in this
book, that this is incorrect. The root should be H1933. The address location of the name on the left, will have the corrected name of
the book where the name is found in scripture. The incorrect name of the book will be found on the far right. Below that, will be the
“Hebrew” text (the source we get our English translation from) with the witnesses’ names in blue, for easy viewing. The Fathers
Name will always be in the color red. The English translation will be below the Hebrew text, with the corresponding colors for each
name referenced. I have included a transliteration of the name on each page. If you notice names in the English translation which you
have never seen before, it’s because all the Hebrew names in the text have been restored to their correct pronunciation/spellings.
Yiddish or incorrect transliteration of names will be seen with a line through them. To review transliteration of a name, revisit page 34
of this book.

SECTION 4: Chap 6



                      Yahuah Yasha! Since the Days of Old
Several years back, I took the liberty to personally transcribe a video I watched online. That transcription turned out to be
about 17 pages long. After almost completing this book, I re-visited the 17 page long document. It’s one of my most favorite
documents on The Name of Yahūshâ I have ever had the privilege of owning. I thought to myself that inserting a few pages
of that information would be a great addition to the book. But it just wasn’t going to compare with how much better the
entire document is. I then decided it was no contest. The finishing cap on this book was going to have to be the transcribed
video of Yahūah Yashâ! Since the days of old. Enjoy!

There are a lot of inconsistencies from many teachers when it comes to the (shūâ) and (shâ) complex. I have written
several articles on it and broken down the many different false names of the Mashýacḥ such as yeshūâ, yahoshūâ,
yahūshūâ and many others. Awhile back in my studies, I came across something very interesting in the Ṭūrah/‫תורה‬. I
discovered that Yahūah’s Name was preceded by or was followed by the SHÂ root. I began to notice that there is a
saying in the Ṭūrah/‫ תורה‬about Yahūah SHÂ. Now, I had never seen that before because I had never done my studies
extensively from Hebrew. So, that’s what I want to share with you: YAHŪAH YASHÂ! Since the Days of Old.

With a little research you will find the root (Hebrew reference number) H3467 of Yashâ/‫ ישע‬is found in so many other
words attached to Yahūah/‫ יהוה‬all thru the Ṭūrah/‫תורה‬. I had someone tell me they were a bit concerned that I used
the Strong’s Concordance. When I give you Strong’s numbers, I’m giving these as reference numbers. When you begin to
go through study tools such as the Thayer’s, the TDNT and the Brown Driver Briggs, they do have that Strong’s number
attached to the word you want to look up. So they are referenced by that. I’m not giving you H3467 to go to the back of
your Concordance. You would never find out the full meaning. The Strong’s numbers are to aid you in a detailed
research of the etymological study of the word back to its root meaning. Again, I’m not telling you to go to the back of
your Concordance to find the true etymological meaning of the word in question. You must understand how to use
those reference numbers.

So, the ref# for YASHÂ/‫ ישע‬is the H3467 and means: deliver, help, salvation, victory. We are going to see how the
conjugated form of this word is found all through the Ṭūrah/‫ תורה‬and all about Yahūah/‫ יהוה‬directly giving salvation.

The Ṭūrah/‫ תורה‬reveals so many beautiful accolades about Yahūshâ/‫יהושע‬. He is the lion and the lamb, the High
Kahan, a warrior, friend, brother and deliverer. But most importantly, He is Yahūah Yashâ! This is one of the many
beauties of the Name that pull believers away from the use of Yahūah Shūâ. And that’s what this is all about. For those
of you who still think The Saviors Name is Yashūâ or Yahushūâ, we will take an in-depth look at YAHŪAH YASHÂ.

When we take The Name of Yahūah/‫יהוה‬, Ref# H3068, and the shortened form of that which is the H3050, Ya/‫יה‬, and
add that to the H3467 which is YASHÂ/‫ ישע‬, we get: Yahūah/‫ יהוה‬+ Yashâ/‫ =ישע‬YAHŪSHÂ/‫יהושע‬. The ref# affiliated
with The Name YAHŪSHÂ is the H3091. So, problems enter into the equation when people get confused about vowel
points: The Kabuts. When The Name of Yahūshâ was introduced in the Ṭūrah/‫תורה‬, there were no vowel points. It was
written as Yahūshâ/‫ יהושע‬and not as Yahūshūâ/‫יהושוע‬. Now, for the Nabýå Isaiah, his true name in Hebrew is
YashâYahū/‫יהשעיהו‬. Some versions display this name as YeshâYahū. Here is the basic root for Isaiah:
                                                                                                                  Page 336 of 396

                            H3467=‫ ישע‬- YASHÂ (y-shâ) meaning deliver, help, salvation, victory
                               H3050=‫ – יה‬YA – a shortened form of H3068=‫ יהוה‬- YAHŪAH
                                         Same exact basic roots for The Saviors Name!

H3470 is the ref# for the name YashâYahū. INTERESTING! No one defending the name Yahūshūâ or Yeshūâ or Yehoshūâ
ever calls YashâYahū YESHŪÂYAHŪ! No one ever says that. Why? Because they understand that H3467, the yad/‫י‬,
shan/‫ש‬, and âýn/‫)ישע( ע‬, gives us -YASHÂ - opposed to YaSHŪÂ. So when you take a look at that H3467 plus H3050, it
gives us YashâYahū and not YashūâYahū.

Another Hebrew name to examine is Hosea/Hoshajah. That’s the canonized/Yiddish way of saying his name. But his real
name was HŪSHÂYAH. He had the exact same spelling of The Mashýacḥ's Name with the exception of the YA/‫ יה‬that
was at the end of the ŪSHÂ/‫ ושע‬root. {HŪSHÂ-YAH/Hosea} {YAHŪSHÂ/Savior} This ref# H1954 HŪSHÂ/‫ הושע‬which
means deliverance, plus YA/‫ יה‬which is the H3050= HŪSHÂYAH/‫הושעיה‬, also goes back to the H3467 YASHÂ/‫ישע‬. No
one ever calls this man HŪ-SHŪÂ-YAH. Because they would know his name is HŪshâYah. (The root H3467 YASHÂ/‫ישע‬
supports the SHÂ spelling not the SHŪÂ spelling.)

When we look at Joshua's original name, he had the same name as the Nabýå Hosea. HŪSHÂ. No one ever says that
Joshua's original name was HŪ-SHŪÂ. Because most people understand that his name was Hūshâ. So, as I move into
this, you will see that what we read in the English and what is said in the Hebrew, is actually a revelation of The Name of
The Mashýacḥ before the fortelling of His Name in ZakarYah/Zech chapter 6.

B-mdbar/Num 10:9 “And when you go into battle in your land against the enemy that distresses you, then you shall shout with the

trumpets, and you shall be remembered before ‫ יהוה‬your Ålahým/‫ אלהים‬and you shall be saved from your enemies.

Saved: There's that SHÂ/‫ שע‬root.

                                                           ‫נושעתים‬
                                                          nūshâṭhým
                                                       ~you shall be saved~
                                                      Derives from H3467
                                                            YASHÂ


The word NŪSHÂ/‫ נושע‬is derived from the H3467. It's in the plural form as in 'all of you.' When we say "our" or Âmanū,
(taken from the study of Emmanuel: see website video "Who is Emmanuel" (www.yahuahislife.com) it has a meaning of
"us" ÂMANŪ/‫עמנו‬. It’s the same thing here with the NŪSHÂ/‫נושע‬. The H3467 is the word for saved here. You shall be
YASHÂ! You shall be SHÂ! You shall be saved! You shall be delivered. What I want to do right now is give you a few cases
where the SHÂ root is used without the Hebrew letter yad/‫ י‬attached to it. It's not YASHÂ/‫ ישע‬here, it's actually
NŪSHÂ/‫ נושע‬saying, "All of you will be delivered."
                                                  (B-mdbar/Num 10:9 Hebrew text)

    ‫וכי־תבאו מלחמה בארצכם על־הצר הצרר אתכם והרעתם בחצצרות ונזכרתם לפני יהוה אלהיכם‬

                                                                                                                      Page 337 of 396

Let's take a look now at Ṭahalým/Psalms 50:23 to build a foundation before we get into the meat of the matter because
I think it's going to WOW all of you. It wow'd me!


Ṭahalým/Ps 50:23 “Whoever     offers praise esteems Me; And to him who prepares a way, I show the deliverance of Ålahým/‫אלהים‬.”
I show by "YASHÂ/‫ ישע‬Ålahým!" THE deliverance. We know to say THE using HA/‫ ה‬or Ba/‫ ב‬in the Hebrew. So, this
verse is actually saying, "Whoever offers praise to me, and to him who prepares a way, I show:

                                                             ‫בישע אלהים‬
                                                             ba-yashâ Ålahým
                                                       ~the deliverance of Ålahým~
                                                              yashâ -   ‫ישע‬
                                                                 H3467
                                                                 Yashâ

I show the deliverance of Ålahým: this is not SHŪÂ, like we are crying out to be saved, this is actual deliverance. This is
personal deliverance by YASHÂ/‫ ישע‬Âlahým/‫אלהעם‬. So He's saying, whoever prepares the way and esteems Him, he
show's YASHÂ/‫ ישע‬of Ålahým; He shows deliverance. Who is our deliverer? YA-HŪSHÂ. Yahūshâ!

If you esteem Yahūah, and if you prepare the way, He will show you YASHÂ. The YASHÂ of Ålahým. We know that the
Deliverance of The Mighty One is YAHŪSHÂ. That’s what this scripture is pointing to: The Mashýacḥ!

We will look at one more in YashâYahū/‫( ישעיהו‬Isaiah) before we get into the meat of the topic: YashâYahū/Isaiah 45:8


Just think: no one says YASHŪÂYAHŪ. If the word YASHÂ/‫ ישע‬is the yad/‫ י‬- shan/‫ ש‬- âýn/‫ע‬, and is the same word that
is attached to YAHŪSHÂ'S/‫ יהושע‬Name, how do we call him YAHŪSHŪÂ and NOT call YashâYahū YASHŪÂYAHŪ?
Hebrew is very, very consistent. What happens when you remove vowel points without any understanding of how to
read the Hebrew text as it is written? You become inconsistent!

I remember when I was in Israel among the congregation there, (they were proclaimers of the "weh" suffix affixed to
Yah's Name) they said, "You have to use vowel points". But the actual vowel points would have changed His Name to
"hovah" and not "wey". So then they say, "Well, the vowel points are not accurate on this particular word." I think it's
amazing that the people that use vowel points have even gone further to say, "Well, the vowel points were written
wrong on THIS word. They should have been written like this…"

The Masoretes knew what they were doing when they wrote the vowel points. They were writing in deception. So, what
you're saying is, THAT form of deception is wrong- but this is the correct form of deception. C'mon.
                                                                                                                  Page 338 of 396

Let's look at YashâYahū/Isa 45:8. We are talking about Yahūah Yashâ. I'm giving you words for YASHÂ/‫ ישע‬right now:
deliverance; savior; avenger; salvation, all these things found in that word. But when you look up SHŪÂ/‫ שוע‬which is
the Strong's #H7769, you will find it means the opposite: to scream, cry, cry out, halloo, or to wail. I will explain this
word further a little later when we look at "What is SHŪÂ?"

So, let's look now at YashâYahū/Isa 45:8 –

Isa 45:8 “Rain down, O heavens, from above, and let clouds pour down Righteousness. Let the earth open, let them bring forth
deliverance, and let Righteousness spring up together. I, ‫יהוה‬, have created it.

Åny/‫ אני‬Yahūah/‫ – יהוה‬I, Yahūah, have created it. Let them bring forth salvation! You know what the word here is for
salvation? YASHÂ/‫ישע‬: The H3467. We know that Isaiah's name means 'Yahū is salvation' or 'Salvation of Yah'. We
know that’s what Isaiah's name means. His name is Yashâ-Yahū and carries the same basic roots for The Son's Name.
YAHŪSHÂ! Yah of salvation, salvation of Yah, Yah is salvation or "Oh, Yah saves!" It depends on how you are breaking
down the etymology. It's all associated with SHÂ/‫שע‬.

Now, the part I'm excited about to get into, is the actual Hebrew where we get to see Yahūah's Name with the åūt/‫את‬,
(the first and the last), knowing this is talking about Yahūshâ with the YSHÂ/‫ ישע‬attached to it! You will find this so
many times in the Hebrew script, I couldn’t even write down all the times I found it. But I did take a few notes hoping
you will get just as excited about this as I am. Even more proof that the Father sent Yahūshâ for us: so much so, that
since the days of old, you can find BOTH of these names (Yahūah/‫ יהוה‬and Yahūshâ/‫ )יהושע‬in Ṭūrah/‫תורה‬, together;
giving us a very powerful message.

By the end of this lesson, if you're not smiling, there's something wrong with you. If you are not smiling with even more
proof after the Shūâ vs. Shâ 1, Shūâ vs. Shâ 2, and all the videos about The Name of The Savior; even more proof of The
Name of YAHŪSHÂ. Like, this is something to rejoice about. They are blaspheming The Name of Yahūshâ alright?!! You
have people on YouTube saying, "There is no Son of Yahūah. And then you have others saying, "We only lift up the one
true name of Yahūshūâ!" C'mon, man! Once we get thru these scriptures, you should be rejoicing because Yahūah/‫יהוה‬
just keeps on giving more and more evidence of The Name of The Savior!

Shamūʿål Býṭh/2Sam 8:6 ThenDūd/‫( דוד‬pronounced 'dood') put watch-posts in Åram/‫ ארם‬of Damashaq/‫דמשק‬. And the Åramý/‫ארמי‬
became Dūd/‫ דוד‬servants, and brought gifts. And ‫ יהוה‬saved Dūd/‫ דוד‬wherever he went.
Right here!   - And Yahūah saved ‫ את‬Dūd-

                                                        ‫וישע יהוה את דוד‬

                                           ~and Yahuah Åṭh/‫( את‬Yahūshâ) saved Dud~
                                                             yashâ -   ‫ישע‬
                                                                H3467
                                                                Yashâ


Ū- yashâ= H3467 – Yahūah ‫ את‬Dūd. And Yahūah-‫ = את‬The First and The Last gave YASHÂ/‫ ישע‬H3467, salvation,
deliverance, to Dūd. So, Yahūah Yashâ! The English says Yahūah saved Dūd wherever he went. But the Hebrew says,
Yahūah, The First and The Last saved Dūd. The First and The Last is referring to The Savior. (YashâYahū/Isa 44:6, 48:12,
Cḥazūn/Rev1:11, 17, 2:8, 22:13) Ū Yashâ Yahūah Åṭh - Dūd. Yahūah Yashâ! I know that for some people who are new to the
Hebrew, this lesson is not going to make much sense to you. But that’s ok. Look over these study notes and you will
                                                                                                                 Page 339 of 396

begin to see a powerful message right here in the Hebrew text waiting to be seen. We are seeing The Name of The Son
that cannot be refuted. It cannot be disputed. That’s how rich it is in the text.


Mashlý/Prov 20:22   Do not say, “I repay evil.” Wait for ‫יהוה‬, and He saves you.
Here it is again! Yahūah saves:
                                                     and he saves Yahūah   wait on

                                                          ‫קוה ליהוה וישע‬
                                                     qūah la-Yahūah ū-yashâ
                                                 ~wait on Yahūah, and he saves ~
                                                              yashâ - ‫ישע‬
                                                                 H3467
                                                                 yashâ

-And Yahūah-He-saves. See that? Yahūah Yashâ. The H3068 plus the H3467. Once again, when we look at YASHÂ/‫ישע‬,
we already know that nobody calls the H3467 YASHŪÂ/‫ישוע‬. Everyone calls the H3467 YASHÂ/‫ישע‬. That’s why they say
YashâYahū. And some will say, "Well yeah, deliverance means Yashâ but, without the vowels see, there are two different
forms of YASHÂ…" No, there's not. You have the H3467 and the H3468 which is a derivative of H3467. The scripture
says:

                                                             ‫יהוה ישע‬
                                                        YAHUAH YASHA!!!
                                                      …since the days of old…

Since the days of old he has been saying, Yahūah Yashâ. Not Yahūah Shūa. What I'm doing is I'm reading the English,
then, I'm reading it in the Hebrew. So you can see that all the times where Yahūah Yashâ is, the message is 'Yahūah
Saves'. How do you get The Saviors Name? You take Yahūah/‫ יהוה‬plus Yashâ ‫ישע‬.

                                                      H3068 + H3067 = H3091
                                                       ‫ יהוה‬+ ‫יהושע = ישע‬
                                                     Yahūah + Yashâ = Yahūsha

Dabarým/Deut 33:29 “Blessed  are you, O Yasharʿål/‫ !ישראל‬Who is like you, a people saved by ‫יהוה‬, the shield of your help, and He
who is the sword of your excellency! And your enemies are subdued for you, and you tread down their high places.”


Remember, we did the lesson on Emmanuel. The Hebrew showed it was actually "âmanūʿål" meaning: amongst us.
Do you know what this scripture is saying when it says, "Baruk are you, O Yasharʿål – a people saved by Yahūah?
It actually says:

                                                          ‫עם נושע ביהוה‬
                                                         âm nūshâ b-Yahūah
                                                        ~tribe saved by Yahūah~
                                                             nūshâ -   ‫נושע‬
                                                                 H3467
                                                                 Yashâ
                                                                                                                Page 340 of 396

It combines the âmanū for (amongst us), with the SHÂ. Here you have shâ without the yad/‫י‬. It goes back to H3467.

SHÂ is the actual root of YASHÂ. Yashâ is just saying "He saves." So, when it says a people saved by Yahūah, it says, “âma
nūshâ b- Yahūah”: a people saved; a people delivered; a people having salvation by Yahūah. YAHŪAH NŪSHÂ on this one
opposed to Yahūah SHÂ - The NŪSHA is a derivative of H3467 - YASHÂ. I think this one is beautiful! If you understand
âmanūʿål, then you can really appreciate âmanū shâ! Because its showing that salvation is amongst us. Salvation is in our
presence; in our midst. His Name shall be mighty amongst us – Âmanūʿål. You are a people who has the salvation of
Yahūah amongst you. You are saved by Yahūah. Âmanū shâ b- Yahūah. A very beautiful thing here. I know that some are
not understanding this, but some of you do! So you should be smiling from ear to ear. We should get chapped lips from
smiling too much thinking about the beauty of His Name and how in the Ṭūrah/‫ תורה‬it is shown to us over and over
again.

Remember now, this word nūshâ: the nun/‫ נ‬and the aua/‫ ו‬is added for (nū). For people: to represent a people; in plural
form. Then combined with SHÂ, NŪ-SHÂ/ ‫נושע‬: This is saying, "people saved." Âmanūshâ…Âmanū shâ b- Yahūah: a
people saved by Yahūah. "Yahūah SHÂ since the days of old." That SHÂ root has been affixed to His Name ever since the
beginning! Because it was already being prophesied what was going to happen. We were going to have Yahūah SHÂ, the
family Name; Yahūah ʿåth, The First and The Last in the flesh! Representing The Name of His Father like He said, and
bringing forth what we seen in Ṭūrah/‫ תורח‬about who He was: Salvation. From the root word YASHÂ/‫ – ישע‬the H3467.
Remember I told you the NŪSHÂ: ‫ע‬-‫ש‬-‫ו‬-‫ נ‬is the plural way of saying 'people saved'. If I say, that tribe shall be saved, I
would say NŪSHÂ. Âm-nūshâ combined is âmanūshâ.



                             ‫ ישראל‬shall be saved by ‫ יהוה‬with an everlasting deliverance. You are not to be ashamed nor hurt,
YashâYahū/Isa 45:17 Yasharʿål/
forever and ever.
                                                by Yahūah   shall be saved   Yasharʿål

                                                     ‫ישראל נושע ביהוה‬
                                                Yasharʿål nūshâ b-Yahūah
                                           ~Yasharʿål shall be saved by Yahūah ~
                                                         nūshâ - ‫נושע‬
                                                      derives from H3467
                                                             yashâ

There's that Yahūah SHÂ again. Yasharʿål shall be saved by Yahūah. What's the word for salvation here? NŪSHÂ. It comes
from the SHÂ/‫ ישע‬root: H3467. What's the root of The Saviors Name Yahūshâ? H3467. What's The Father's Name?
Yahūah: H3068. So, here you have again from the days of old, Yahūah and YASHÂ: the salvation; deliverance; the
avenger; of Yahūah. That’s beautiful. Nūshâ b- Yahūah.

I was a little nervous giving this lesson wondering if anyone was going to understand what I'm talking about because
many are not familiar with the Hebrew text. But, if you have been coming into the knowledge of The Name of Yahūshâ,
one of the first names you came across was Yahūshūa. Simply because we don’t understand about the SHÂ and SHŪÂ
root. So, this is just more proof on that. Refer back to the website www.yahuahislife.com and look at the SHŪÂ vs SHÂ
articles. I did two full length articles about this subject and I took all the SHŪÂ names and broke them down in Hebrew
to reveal how they could not be Yahūshūa.
                                                                                                                  Page 341 of 396

Shamūṭh/Ex 14:30 Therefore,   ‫ יהוה‬saved Yasharʿål/‫ ישראל‬that day out of the hand of the Matsarý, and Yasharʿål/‫ ישראל‬saw the
Matsarý/‫ מצרי‬dead on the seashore.
See that? Yahūah saved. Do you know how to say Yahūah saved in Hebrew? You say, Yahūah YASHÂ! Do you know how to say, and
therefore, Yahūah saved? You say, "Ū y-ūshâ Yahūah. You will find the U/‫ ו‬in front of the SHÂ:


                                                            ‫ויושע יהוה‬
                                                        ū y-ūshâ Yahūah
                                               ~and therefore, (he) Yahūah saved ~
                                                               shâ - ‫שע‬
                                                                H3467
                                                                 yashâ

                          Here in Shamūṭh/Exodus chapter 14, it says Yahūah saved. Yahūah SHÂ:

                                                  H3068 + H3067 = H3091
                                                    ‫ יהוה‬+ ‫יהושע = ישע‬
                                                 Yahūah + Yashâ = Yahūshâ
Here's my thing; If the same exact roots from The Saviors Name is Yahūah and YASHÂ, how on earth, do we blaspheme
Him and say He's a cry baby? How do we say He cries out? How do we take the word YAHŪ or Yahūah and attach
SHŪÂ/‫ שוע‬to the end of it? Why can't we see that it's not only a sin, its blasphemy! And then there are brothers and
sisters who know the true Name but still listen to people who defend The Name of Yahūshūâ. Would you call The Savior
Fred? If I began to refer to The Savior as Burtrude, would you listen to me anymore? Of course you wouldn't. Because
you would say, "Oh, that’s not His Name! That’s just wrong!" Yahūshūâ is just as wrong as Burtrude! So, if you wouldn't
listen to me for calling Him Burtrude, why are you listening to someone calling Him Yahūshūâ? It's blasphemy.
Shamūṭh/Exodus even shows Yahūah SHÂ! That’s power! Yahūah SHÂ! Yahūah YASHÂ since the days of old.

Shamūʿål Ålaph/I Sam 14:23 Therefore,   ‫ יהוה‬saved Yasharʿål/‫ ישראל‬that day, and the battle passed over to Býṭh Åūn.

Thus Yahūah saved Yasharʿål. You see, there it is! Thus Yahūah saved Yasharʿål. Now, when you read this it doesn’t say
SHŪÂ! To say, "Therefore Yahūah saved Yasharʿål," we would have this once again:

                                                            ‫ויושע יהוה‬
                                                        ū y-ūshâ Yahūah
                                               ~and therefore, (he) Yahūah saved ~
                                                               shâ - ‫שע‬
                                                                H3467
                                                                 yashâ

I think it's beautiful cause to say, 'Therefore He saved', you would have the UAU/‫( ו‬pronounced 'oo') and then you
would have what looks like 'yoo-sha' which is very close to hoo-sha. Ū Y-ŪSHÂ YAHŪAH! Then you read a little bit more
and it says Yasharʿål Åṭh-The First and the Last: The people of The First and The Last. Here again, 'Therefore, Yahūah
saved'. Therefore Yahūah SHÂ! From the ref# H3467 YASHÂ/‫ישע‬. Therefore Yahūah Ū YASHÂ! No SHŪÂ/‫ שוע‬here! I'm
                                                                                                               Page 342 of 396

saying again, he saved. How did he save? Through SHÂ/‫שע‬. YASHÂ/‫ישע‬. The H3467 which represents the strength of
His salvation. Yahūah Yashâ or Yahūah SHA. Let's move on now to Dabarý Ha Yamým Ålaph/IChr 18:6

Dabarý Ha Yamým Ålaph/IChr 18:6 And   Dūýd/‫ דויד‬stationed [men] in Åram/‫ ארם‬of Damashaq/‫דמשק‬, and the Åramý/‫ ארמי‬became
servants of Dūýd/‫דויד‬, and brought gifts. And ‫ יהוה‬saved ‫ את‬Dūýd/‫ דויד‬wherever he went.



                                                   ‫ויושע יהוה את דויד‬
                                                   u-yūshâ Yahūah Åṭh Dūýd
                                      ~and thus, (He) Yahūah Åṭh/‫( את‬Yahusha) saved Dūýd~
                                                           shâ -   ‫שע‬
                                                            H3467
                                                            Yashâ


We know what the word for salvation is: YASHÂ/‫ישע‬. We know what The Fathers Name is: Yahūah/‫יהוה‬. So that's
Yahūah-YASHÂ. Now, how do you say Yahūah saved David/Dūýd? This is the way we would say it: ū-yūshâ Yahūah Åṭh
Dūýd. Now, this scripture will say Dūýd/‫דויד‬, pronounced doo-eed, because the yad/‫ ו‬was added. The original way it
was written was ‫דוד‬, pronounced dood. So, you will see Dūýd on this one, but it says here: ū-yūshâ Yahūah Åṭh Dūýd!
There it is again: and Yahūah saved Dūýd. Yahūah YASHÂ!

You know, many people say that the SHŪÂ/‫ שוע‬means salvation. But as we are looking this up, we are seeing that when
Yahūah's Name is involved, we have NOT seen Yahūah SHŪÂ/‫ שוע‬Dūd. We are not seeing that. We are seeing: Yahūah
SHÂ or yaSHÂ or ūSHÂ or nūSHÂ. All of these are derivatives of H3467 YASHÂ/‫ישע‬: deliverance; salvation; deliverer;
avenger; YASHÂ. That’s who Yahūshâ is. We don’t apply SHŪÂ/‫ שוע‬to any of these. All we have to do is look into the
Hebrew; since the days of old. We have been getting a foretaste of His Name before it was ever spoken in the ear of
mankind; before it was ever spoken by man as a name, it was already evident for what he did for Dūd and the children
of Yasharʿål. This is so beautiful to me!

                                         ‫ יהוה‬saved ‫ את‬YacḥazaqYahū/‫ יחזקיהו‬and the inhabitants of Yarūshalam/‫ירושלם‬
Dabarý Ha Yamým Býṭh/IIChr 32:22 Therefore,
from the hand of Sanacḥarýb/‫ סנחריב‬the sovereign of Åshūr/‫אשור‬, and from the hand of all others, and guided them on every side.

                        When it says, therefore Yahūah saved YacḥazaqYahū, it says in the Hebrew:

                                               ‫יחזקיהו‬-‫ויושע יהוה את‬
                                           ū-yūshâ Yahūah Åṭh - YacḥazaqYahū
                        ~and therefore, (he) Yahūah Åṭh/ ‫( את‬Yahūshâ) saved YacḥazaqYahū ~
                                                           shâ - ‫שע‬
                                                            H3467
                                                            Yashâ
It's saying here that Yahūah gave the YaSHÂ! He gave deliverance; salvation; to YachazaqYahu. The ‫ את‬is the strength of
His deliverance. What is attached to his deliverance? The SHÂ root. Ū-yūshâ Yahūah Åṭh! It's amazing because it's
spelled y-u-s-h-a. The yad/‫ י‬is just saying (he). So, you would say 'he saved' like this: y-ūsha. It sounds very close to
Yahū-shâ. You will see a little bit later, we will look at the phrase: 'Yahūah is your salvation'. The way you would write
                                                                                                                    Page 343 of 396

'your salvation' in Hebrew is Mashý-acḥ. Writing certain phrases in Hebrew includes attaching particular characters to a
given word causing it to mean something new. (Conjugated forms of words) I find it amazing to see here that "Yahūah
saved" is Yahūah y-ūshâ. Sounding like Yahūah Yahūshâ. Yet it is said y- ŪSHÂ, without the Ha/‫ה‬. No one can look at the
Hebrew text and say this is SHŪÂ or means SHŪÂ. But people will take these same roots and put them together and call
those SHŪÂ. It's evident right here. This is all SHÂ. Because that’s what Yahūah gave us. He gave us deliverance through
His Son: our savior; our Mashýacḥ; YAHŪSHÂ.
Now, we are going to look at the Yahūshâ root with an extra yad/‫י‬

Shamūʿål Ålaph/I Sam 17:47 and all this assembly know that ‫ יהוה‬does not save with sword and spear, for the battle belongs to ‫יהוה‬,
and He shall give you into our hands.”
When he says here that he saves not, it actually says:

                                                            ‫יהושיע יהוה‬
                                                          y-hūshýâ Yahūah
                                                      ~ Yahūah saves/delivers ~
                                                             hūshýâ - ‫הושיע‬
                                                                 H3467
                                                                 Yashå

You have Yahūshâ/‫ יהושע‬with a yad/‫ י‬between the shan/‫ ש‬and the âýn/‫ע‬. YahūshYâ. We will find out later how this is
connected to the Hebrew phrase Hūshýʿâh nå (Hosanna). It's all going back to the same thing: that Yahūah saves. The
'saves not' of course is 'la Yahūah'. ('La' meaning 'no')The "Yahūah saves" in the phrase, 'Yahūah saves not by the
sword', is actually saying in the Hebrew: y-hūshyâ Yahūah – Yahūah saves - When you look this up in the interlinear, it
will give you the root H3467 YASHÂ/‫ישע‬. All these are different forms of the word YASHÂ. It means the power and the
strength of our salvation, not SHŪÂ.

Ṭahalým/Ps 118:25 I   pray, O ‫יהוה‬, please save; I pray, O ‫יהוה‬, please send prosperity.
Now, this is the word in the Hebrew you will see as: Hūshýʿâh nå – this is the word where the Greeks get Hosanna from:


                                                                G 5614
                                                                ὡσαννά
                                                               `osannah
                                                              (ho-san-nah)
                                                            save, we pray!
                                                         from H3467 & H4994


Hosanna means 'save us, we pray' or 'save me, I pray'. It will show you when you go to the G5614, it shows that Hosanna
comes from Hebrew. It shows you the Hebrew root of H3467 which is YASHÂ, and the H4994 NA/‫( נא‬I pray)yashâ-nå.
When its saying 'save us I pray', it's not saying Hosanna.
                                                                                                                    Page 344 of 396

From the original text, the Hebrew, its saying:

                                                        ‫יהוה הושיעה נא‬
                                                        Yahūah hūshýʿâh nå
                                                    ~ save us we pray Yahūah ~
                                                           hūshýâ - ‫הושיע‬
                                                               H3467
                                                               yashâ

                                The verse referring to the word Hosanna is MaṭhaṭhYahū/Matt 21:9, 15
So, the original way to say 'save us we pray' is hūshyʿâh nå. The Greeks say it as Hosanna. Here in Ṭahalým/Ps 118:25 when
it says 'I pray oh Yahūah please save', its saying, Yahūah hūshýʿâh nå! Please save, Yahūah! No one would say reading
this verse in the Hebrew, 'Yahūah hūshūâýʿâh nå. No one would say that. Because it is clear this is a SHÂ root.
All these SHÂ roots are affixed to Yahūah's Name in front or after them; showing that He is The Beginning and The End
of our salvation! Like, this is like really, really beautiful! Like, are you not smiling yet?
Lets move on- I got to get a smile out of you before this is over with.

Ṭahalým/Ps 3:7 Arise, O ‫ ;יהוה‬Save me, O my Ålahým/‫ !אלהים‬Because You have smitten all my enemies on the cheek; You have
broken the teeth of the wrong.

These verses are now all saying, ‘Hūshýʿâh nå’. All from the SHÂ root. Hūshýʿâh nå, Save us, I pray! Save us we pray!
When he says, Arise, O ‫ ;יהוה‬Save me, O my Ålahým/‫ !אלהים‬he is saying:


                                                          ‫יהוה הושיעני‬
                                                         Yahūah hūshýʿâný
                                                    ~ save me I pray Yahūah ~
                                                          hūshýâ - ‫הושיע‬
                                                              H3467
                                                              yashâ
                                                       Hūshýʿâný = save me
                                                       Hūshýʿâh nå = save us

'Arise Yahūah, save me!' is what this is saying and it comes from the SHÂ root. From the Hebrew: Yahūah hūshýʿâný.
Now, we know the only difference between hūshâ/‫ הושע‬and hushý/‫ הושי‬is the use of the yad/‫ י‬and the âýn/‫ע‬.
This is just so beautiful. All these different forms of the word YASHÂ, the H3467, are all attached to Yahūah's Name:
Yahūah Hūshýʿâný; Yahūah hūshýʿâh nå; Yahūah hūshâ; Yahūah shâ; Yahūah yashâ; because he is our salvation!
Ṭahalým/Ps 12:1 Save,   ‫יהוה‬, for the kind one is no more! For the trustworthy have ceased from among the sons of men.

                                                          ‫יהוה הושיעה‬
                                                          Yahūah hūshýʿâh
                                                       ~ save (me) Yahūah ~

                                                               H3467

     All these scriptures are saying the same thing: hūshýʿâh nå, hūshýʿâný, hūshýʿâh nū; save us, save, save me. What's the
    word for salvation here? It’s the H3467 SHÂ. They are all attached to Yahūah's Name because Yahūah SHÂ. Yahūah
    saves: YAHŪAH YASHÂ = HE SAVES YAHŪSHÂ = salvation is of Yahūah; Yahūah is salvation; Yahūah is deliverer; Yahūah
    is avenger. When you say, Yahū-SHŪÂ, you are saying he cries. You're going to see when we look at SHŪÂ, that the
    scripture says 'My servant will not cry out'. That’s what the scripture says! Whenever you say he cries out, you call him a
    liar. Because it says that His servant will not cry out; the one coming for us will not cry out. So Yahūshâ could not have
    been Yahūshūâ because that would mean he cries out. Doesn’t mean wealth, riches or noble, it means 'he cries'. It’s a
    sin to even say that. So, let's move on.

    Ṭahalým/Ps 20:9 Save,   ‫ !יהוה‬Let the Sovereign answer us in the day we call.
    Same thing! Save, Yahūah! This is personal. Save, Yahūah. (The 'me' is implicated) Hūshýʿâh nå Yahūah! Same root again.

                                                               ‫יהוה הושיעה‬

                                                      Yahūah + Yashâ = Yahūshâ

                                                            YAHUAH YASHA!!!
                                                           …since the days of old…

Since Shamūṭh/Exodus! And I want to tell you, I looked up every YASHÂ. I looked up every H3467 and every single H3468. I
read the etymology for every single form. I'm not doing guess work here. I looked all of this up. Look them up for yourself
and you will see that it's always Yahūah SHÂ, Yahūah NŪSHÂ, Yahūah ÂMANŪSHÂ, Yahuah HŪSHÝʿÂH NÅ, Yahūah
HŪSHÝʿÂNÝ; all from Yahūah and YASHÂ – the H3467. I started off showing you when you take the [H3068 Yahūah] and
combine it with the [H3067 YASHA], you get YAHŪSHÂ! Let's move on. We are looking at each conjugated form separately.

YashâYahū/ Isa 49:26 “And   I shall feed those who oppress you with their own flesh, and let them drink their own blood as sweet wine. All
flesh shall know that I, ‫יהוה‬, am your Saviour, and your Redeemer, the Ålahým/‫ אלהעם‬of Yʿâqb.”
I like this one…we know that Yahūshâ is our Mashýacḥ. Do you know how to say Yahūah is your Savior?


                                                          ‫כי אני יהוה מושיעך‬
                                                           ký åný Yahūah mūshýak
                                                    ~ for I am Yahūah: your salvation ~
                                                                mūshýâ - ‫מושיע‬
                                                                    H3467
                                                                    yashâ
                                                                                                                          Page 346 of 396

Mūshýak sounds like Mashýacḥ. In Hebrew to say 'your', you have to end a word with ‫ך‬. The word used here is mūshʿâh.




                                                                ‫מושעה‬
                                      mūshʿâh (moo-shah) H4190 comes from H3467 YASHÂ/‫ישע‬
                                                                deliverance



   If you want to say deliverance or savior you would say mūshâ. To say I am your savior you would say mūshýak.
   What do we know about Yahūshâ?

                                                  mūshýak (moo-shee-ahk) = your savior
                                                                H4190
                                                                   ‫מושיעך‬


                                                 mashýacḥ (ma-shee-acḥ) =anointed one

                                                                    H4899
                                                                    ‫משיח‬
   I think this is so beautiful because once you really start learning how to read and write Hebrew, you will see how words
   come together with characters being added to mirror the same sound of other words having the same meaning when
   they are in context. How much can you twist mūshýak? Read it for yourself. Mūshýak. I, Yahūah Am your Savior; your
   Deliverance; your Salvation; your Avenger; your Protection; The One that Covers you. Mūshýak sounds just like
   Mashýacḥ.

   That’s how you say 'your Savior' in Hebrew.




   YashâYahū/Isa 60:16 “And   you shall drink dry the milk of the gentiles, and shall milk the breast of sovereigns. And you shall know that
   I, ‫יהוה‬, am your Saviour and your Redeemer, the Ålahým/‫ אלהעם‬of Yʿâqb.




                                               When it says, 'I, Yahūah your Savior', it says:
                                                           ‫אני יהוה מושיעך‬
                                                            åný Yahūah mūshýak
                                                       ~ I am Yahūah: your savior ~
                                                               mūshýâ - ‫מושיע‬
                                                                   H3467
                                                                   yashâ
                                                                                                           Page 347 of 396

For I, Yahūah (self-existent; the eternal) mūshýʿâk. Åný Yahūah mashýacḥ. I, Yahūah, Am your Savior, your Salvation. This
is all related to this root H3467 which is YASHÂ/‫ישע‬. But if you look at the Hebrew 4190, the word mūshʿâh is used. It’s
from the use of this word mūshʿâh that we get mashýʿâk. So, when you take 'your' which is represented by the kaf/‫ך‬,
with mūshâh/4190 with YASHÂ/3467 you get mūshýʿâk. I said along time ago that Hebrew words break down into two
or three basic roots. Many Hebrew words are compound: YashâYahū; Yahūshâ; Yahūah…

Looking at the word Hūsha: you have [Hu] which is to say Oh! or Alas! Then you have [Shâ] Together they say Hūshâ.
This word here mūshýʿâk breaks down to the 4190 for mūshah , which comes from the 3467-YASHÂ; and to say 'your' in
Hebrew, add the kaf/‫ ך‬to the end and that makes it 'yours'. Notice: none of these contain any portion of the H7769
SHŪÂ. Otherwise he would be saying I am the one that cries. Someone said to me, ''Well, doesn't he cry out when we
sin?'' I don’t understand why we rationalize things. Does he cry when we sin? Yes, he's disappointed and he is also angry.
Do we rationalize putting anger or sad at the end of His Name? We have to call him what he said to call him. Zakaryah 6:
10-12, reading about the high Kahan (Yahūshâ). ZakarYah takes the crown of silver and gold and sets it on the head of
the high Kahan and he said, ''Behold! The man whose Name is The Branch!'' We did a study on The Branch. Yahūshâ
himself says, ''I Am The Branch''. He said He was the root, the offspring of Jesse found in Cḥazūn/Rev 22:16. We have to
call him by The Name His Father said His Name would be. This is just more proof that since the days of old, the
H3068/Yahūah has always been used in conjunction with the H3467/YASHÂ. Because…

                                                       ‫יהוה ישע‬
                                                  YAHUAH YASHA!!!
                                                  …since the days of old

B-mdbar/Num 13:8 From the tribe of Åpharým: Hūsha, son of Nūn.
I want to show you something about Joshua: (for all the SHUA observers) what's the original name of Joshua? They say
it's Hoshea. I'll say, ''Don't give me the Greek or the English/Yiddish counterpart. What was Joshua's original name in the
Hebrew before Mashah changed it?

They never comment on that. The only difference between the original name of Joshua and The Name of The Savior, is
the yad/‫י‬. The remaining letters in both names are identical in sequence. They are exactly the same! No one calls Joshua
'Hushua'. His name was 'Hūshâ' with the H1954 which means, 'deliverer'. Some may say his name was Hoseah. We
know that’s not Hebrew. There is no 'Ho' pronunciation in Hebrew. The 'Ho' does not exist. For the black Hebrew
Israelites preaching about the name Yehoshua: your saying, Yeho cries. I don’t know what 'Ye' means. If your taken the
'Ye' to be the yad/‫ י‬which represents the 'hand', then you're saying ''the hand of the ho that cries.'' Where does the 'Ho'
come from? There is no 'Ho' in Hebrew. In some versions Joshua's name is spelled 'Oshea son of Nūn'. These are all
Yiddish forms.

                                                          H1954
                                                    ‫הושע‬
                                               Husha (hoo-sha')
                                                       Deliverer

Hūshâ was his original name! The only difference between his name and The Savior was before Masha added the yad/‫י‬.
The name HūshâYah which is the H1955 we looked at earlier carries Hūshâ as well.
                                                                                                                 Page 348 of 396

Let’s look at verse 16 of the same chapter.

B-mdbar/Num 13:16 These are the names of the men whom Mashah sent to spy out the land. And Mashah called Hūshâ the son of
Nūn, Yahūshâ.

See this? Mashah changed his name. He began to call him by a different name. What does Hūshâ mean? Hūshâ means
deliverance. It comes from the root of SHÂ the H3467. When you put the yad/‫ י‬in front of Hūshâ, now you have Ya +
Hūshâ = Yahūshâ.
                                             How did Joshua's name: Hūshâ

                                                            ‫הושע‬
                                                       become yahūshūâ?

                                                          ‫יהושוע‬
                                              Wouldn’t HUSHA + YA = YAHUSHA?
                                             How does HUSHA + YA = YAHUSHUA?
                                                  By way of ignorance only.


Now, I'm going to show you The Fathers Name was adjacent to just Hūsha by itself.

When you look up Hūsha, it does show the Strong's H3467; but it also shows the H1954. You can actually find Yahūah's
Name in Hūsha! Because we know Hūsha means salvation:

YaramYahū/Jer 31:7 For thus said ‫יהוה‬, “Sing with gladness for Yʿâqb, and shout among the chief of the nations. Cry out, give
praise, and say, ‘O ‫יהוה‬, save Your people, the remnant of Yasharʿål!’
When it says, 'Yahūah save your people', it says:


                                                    ‫הושע יהוה את עמך‬
                                                  hūshâ Yahūah Åṭh ʿâmak
                                          ~Yahūah Åṭh (Yahūshâ), save your tribe ~
                                                         Hūshâ - ‫הושע‬
                                                       H1954 from H3467
                                                            Yashâ


Hūsha! Deliver; save, Yahūah: your people. âmak: âm - we translate this 'am' to 'people'. It technically means tribe.
H5971 ‫( עם‬âm)=people, a congregated unit; specifically: a tribe –    ‫=עמך‬your tribe. ‫=ך‬kaf
There's the conjugated form right there. The kaf makes it 'your tribe'. The ‫ את‬reveals the tribe of 'The First and The Last'.
So, here you have The Mark of The First and The Last, with a portion of The Name He would carry when He came to
earth! Hūshâ Yahūah Åṭh âmak – The First and The Last Yahūah-Hūshâ your people: save; bring salvation; deliver your
people. Is this beautiful? None of these scholars and SHŪÂ people will look at this and say Hūshūâ. Cause guess what?
The Masorites didn’t even vowel point this to say Hūshūâ. They vowel pointed it to say, Hosea. Even they are not calling
this SHŪÂ. Think about it. The Masorites invented the vowel points to change the language. They don’t even call Hūshâ
SHŪÂ. So, how do you explain calling Hūshâ 'Hūshūâ' when you put a yad/‫ י‬in front of it. Even the Jews weren’t that
                                                                                                           Page 349 of 396

deceptive when they did this ok? They were deceptive and caused a lot of people to go astray, and many may burn
because of this. But they don’t even do that SHŪÂ thing on this one here. They pronounce this as Hosea. But they send it
back to the H3467 YASHA. When you go to the H3467 there is only ONE way they pronounce it: YSHÂ. They do not put
SHŪÂ to it. So when you look at Hūshâ it goes back to YASHÂ. Where does the SHŪÂ come from? It comes from your
mind! That’s where it comes from. You're making it up. It does not exist.

That’s Hūshâ Yahūah! Now, let's go to Hūshâ/Hosea 1:7!
Hūshâ/Hosea 1:7 “But I shall have compassion on the house of Yahūdah/‫ יהודה‬and save them by ‫ יהוה‬their Ålahým/‫אלהים‬, and
not save them by bow or by sword or battle, by horses or horsemen.”

Hūshâ(Hosea) had the same name as Hūshâ (Joshua) in the beginning. Then Mashah changed his name to Yahūshâ
because we know that Joshua was a foreshadow of the Mashýacḥ to come. So much so, that even when everyone was
removed from the tent of meeting, when Yahūah was speaking to Mashah only, (Shamūṭh/Exodus 33:11) guess who
was in the back of the tent listening? The one who carried the same name of the coming Mashýacḥ! That’s right! Joshua
stayed in the tent. That Name remained in the tent. What did Yahūah tell the men who were with ZakarYah? He said.
''You men are men of symbol". We know that the high Kahan Yahūshâ carried The Name of The Mashýacḥ. So when
Yahūah is speaking through ZakarYah to these men in chapter 1: 1-3 of ZakarYah/Zech, he's telling them, 'you men are
men of symbol'. There something about you-you're going to symbolize something. We know that the high Kahaným
father's name was Yahūtsadaq which means Yahūah is Righteousness; we read about the fortelling of him being called,
'bn Yahūtsadaq' –Son of Righteousness. C'mon people! We can't put this together and figure out what His name is? We
can’t put this together and see that no one is twisting scriptures here?



                                                     ‫והושעתים ביהוה‬
                                                   ū- hūshaṭhým b-Yahūah
                                                 ~and save them by Yahūah ~
                                                         Hūshâ - ‫הושע‬
                                                       H1954 from H3467
                                                            yashâ

Two words here once again: Hūshâ-Yahūah

To save them is to say Hūshaṭhým. We know that the 'ym' is plural, so the thym provides the ‘them’. The two basic roots
again: Hūshâ-H1954 which goes back to the H3467, and you have Yahūah-H3068

                                                              ‫יהוה‬
                                                         Yahuah (ya-hoo-ah)
                                                    self-existent, the eternal

Yahūah Hūshâ. We have seen Yahūah SHÂ, Yahūah y-ūshâ, Yahūah hūshýʿâh nå, Yahūah hūshâ…all these words! The
Strong's, the interlinear, the Masoretic text, they all say the same thing. They all say these names go back to the root of
salvation. YASHÂ: H3467. Lets put one and one together. In no country does 1+1=1.5million. No country on the earth. If
you asked a 3 yr old what 1+1 is they may say, ''75 trillion-billion.'' They don’t understand numbers. Everywhere you go
2x2=4. So, everywhere you have the Masoretic text, I don’t care what 'version' you are using, they all know that this
SHÂ- all my etymology books; I don’t care how old they are or new they are; the references on line; they all reference
back to YASHÂ. If I say No, it means no. No has the same meaning in every language: negative; cant do it; stop it brother;
                                                                                                                    Page 350 of 396

not feelin` you; no; lo; la…they may say it different ways but the connotation is the same. Same thing here:
It’s the SHÂ/Yahūah Hūshâ!

ZakarYah/Zech 12:7 “And   ‫ יהוה‬shall save the tents of Yahūdah/‫ יהודה‬first, so that the comeliness of the house of Dūd/‫ דוד‬and the
comeliness of the inhabitants of Yarūshalam would not become greater than that of Yahūdah/‫יהודה‬.


                                                    ‫והושע יהוה את אהלי‬
                                                 ū- hūshâ Yahūah Åṭh åhalý
                                         ~and Yahūah Åṭh (Yahūshâ) saves the tents ~
                                                           Hūshâ - ‫הושע‬
                                                         H1954 from H3467
                                                              yashâ

Here it is again: and Yahūah shall save = Ū-HŪSHÂ Yahūah. There's that word Hūsha again which goes back to the
Strong's root of H3467, but I want you to actually look up the word 'HŪSHÂ'. It’s the H1954. So this is saying Yahūah will
save; Yahūah HŪSHÂ. What do you get if you take Yahūah, (the H3068) and Hūshâ, (the H1954) and put them together?

                                                  H3068 + H1954 = H3091
                                                 ‫ יהוה‬+ ‫יהושע = הושע‬
                                                Yahūah + Hūshâ = Yahūshâ

                                                    If you take Yahūah + Yashâ?

                                                  H3068 + H3067 = H3091
                                                  ‫ יהוה‬+ ‫יהושע = ישע‬
                                                Yahūah + Yashâ = Yahūshâ

                          All these roots derive from the H3467 YASHÂ. So! What does all this mean?

Probably to a lot of you, absolutely nothing! This is just a foretaste when you begin to dig into this study. This shows you
that Yahūah's Name is not found adjacent to SHŪÂ! This is the thing: anytime Yahūah tells us something; we can go back
and find evidence of this already existing. When we talk about the Branch: the Tsamaq; the coming Mashýacḥ-we can go
back and see the word Mūshýak meaning 'I am your salvation'. Who created the heavens and the earth? Everyone says,
'Oh, Yahūah did!' YAHŪSHÂ created the heavens and the earth. He bore the family Name of Yahūah. Yahūah is a family
Name. In the beginning, Ålahým(that’s the mighty ones) Åṭh: what did Yahūshâ say in Cḥazūn/Rev chapter 1? He said, ''I
Am Åṭh. When you read about that, that’s me. I Am The First and The Last!" All through Ṭūrah we see Yahūah, and we
see Yahūah Åṭh. What did he say? …and Yahūah rained down fire from Yahūah. And then Yahūah, before Mashah, was
testifying before The Name of Yahūah. And then, Yahūah rebuked them in The Name of Yahūah. And Yahūah is saying, 'I
will save them by The Name of Yahūah. Why is there two Yahūah's talking? Remember Yahūshâ said that no one has
ever heard The Fathers Voice. [sic] (Note: I have not found this hightlighted statement in the accounts of Yahūshâ, to be
accurate within the context of His message found in Yahūchanan/Jn 5:37. These men were uncircumcised in heart and
were incapable of hearing the Voice of The Father. Many have heard The Voice of The Father, because they have
received His Word and did what His Word instructed. That is how to “hear” Him; by doing it. For further study, see these
                                                                                                                 Page 351 of 396

passages: Matt 17:5, Mark 1:11, 9:7; Luke 3:22, 9:34-36; Jn 5:37-38, 10:3-4, 16, 27, 12:27-30, 18:37 ) So, who was it that
spoke? Who was it? Every time Yahūah speaks, through that rūacḥ, that breath, Yahūshâ is. That’s how His
manifestation came about. He is The Living Word of Yahūah. We don’t have living words. When I talk, you can't see
words forming. When Yahūah speaks, His Word took form. That’s The Power of Yahūah. That’s who Yahūshâ is.

So, when we see all these things we see that there is a family Name: Yahūah; And there is evidence of deliverance
coming to us because of our sins. We know the way to say deliverance in Hebrew, the true root way: salvation;
deliverer; avenger. We know that’s YASHÂ. And now, we have even more scripture that shows His Name; Yahūah,
Yahūah Åṭh-The First and The Last, was always associated with the SHÂ root. So much so, that we see hūshýʿâh nå, we
see shâ, we see hūshâ, we see y-ūshâ, we see mūshýak. All these are associated with His Name, so when He came to
earth He was The Son of Righteousness. We know that The Father is Righteousness. So He was Yahūah tsadaq.
(Yahūtsadaq) He was our mashýacḥ because we have seen Yahūah mūshýak, Yahūah your salvation. We've seen this. He
was The Deliverer because we have seen Yahūah HŪSHÂ, Yahūah YASHÂ. This is a lot of information…it may take a while
to digest it but I really want to see how anyone could take in all this information, plus the two articles on SHŪÂ vs SHÂ,
and still not understand the power of the deliverance of The First and The Last: YAHŪSHÂ. Its so beautiful how it all
comes together. That’s how it is; whenever you are dealing with truth, Yahūah continues to reveal things to you line
upon line, precept upon precept. Everything you learn is totally supported by what you have already learned, and will
support what you will learn.

I hope you enjoyed this lesson…go back and really dig into this. I want you to look at something…look at all your
interlinear references and Strong's numbers. For all these scriptures I gave, there is one root they all go back to: H3467.

SECTION 4: Chap 7                                 G2424 STUDY
                                                    Prove it!
Welcome back ladies! You have come a long way if you have read and considered everything in the book up to this point.
I will help you look again, as we did in the first section of this book, into the “Thayer’s Greek Lexicon” for a study on
G2424. Knowing how to find and prove The Saviors Name, is key to knowing His Name. Just because our study materials
say that our Saviors Name is such-n-such, I hope by now, you can clearly see; it does not mean that the information is
correct. We have to learn to prove all things. First, we need to locate The Name in the OT. We know that The Name of
Mashýacḥ was foretold in one of the OT books. Knowing where that verse is located, helps us verify the spelling of The
Name in Hebrew. After we learn how to spell The Name correctly, by its original location in the text, we can then spot
any misspellings in any study source we use. The correct spelling of The Name is crucial to the pronunciation and
meaning of The Name. Next, we have to transliterate The Name into the English; while preserving the sound of each
character, or letter during the transliteration process. The last step is to prove and verify any roots attached to His Name.


Now that you are a bit more familiar with “Strong’s” reference numbers, knowledge about transliteration; the deceptive
twist that comes from vowel pointing, knowledge that God and Lord are not affiliated with the H3068 or the H3091, and
you even know the address of The Name of The Branch; let’s see about going through the G2424 again. This time, with
better understanding, as we take each of these steps to finding His Name; I’m sure it will be a walk in the park. This is the
treasure you can hand down to your children! Ready? Let’s do it.



From the Thayer’s:
G2424
-Original: Ἰησοῦς
- Transliteration: Iesous
- Phonetic: ee-ay-sooce'
- Definition: Jesus = "Jehovah is salvation"
- Origin: of Hebrew origin H3091 - Original: ‫יהושׁע יהושׁו ּע‬
- Transliteration: Y@howshuwa`
- Phonetic: yeh-ho-shoo'-ah
- Definition: Joshua or Jehoshua = "Jehovah is salvation"

Six letter spelling:‫יהושׁוּע‬
Five letter spelling: ‫יהושׁע‬

The first thing we need to be aware of, is that this information is telling us that a Greek name “Jesus”, has a Hebrew origin.
That sends out a red flag already. A Greek Mashýacḥ with Hebrew parents. How we ended up with this name “Jesus”, is
irrelevant to what the H3091 is about to unravel. Assuming section 2 has already been reviewed, we can proceed to study
the spelling of The Name in ZakarYah/Zech 6:11:

KJV
ZakarYah/Zech 6:11 Then        take H3947 silver H3701 and gold H2091, and make H6213 crowns H5850, and set H7760
them upon the head H7218 of Joshua H3091 the son H1121 of Josedech H3087, the high H1419 Kahan H3548

                                               Same passage in Hebrew text:

    ‫ולקחת כסף־וזהב ועשית עטרות ושמת בראש יהושע בן־יהוצדק הכהן הגדול׃‬
                                                                                                                      Page 353 of 396

Notice the H3091 English name in the KJV passage, matches the one in the “Thayer’s” definition, which is Joshūâ, but
the Hebrew Name from the H3091 transliterated “Yahūshâ” doesn’t? In other words, the ‘shūâ’ in “Joshūâ” only
matches the six letter spelling. There are no English variables in our list of choices that match the five letter spelling.
Here are the choices the “Thayer’s” is giving: Jesus, Joshūâ, and Jehoshūâ. If we were to transliterate the five letter
name as it is written, represented by the H3091, it would not match any of the name choices given in the English found in
the “Thayer’s” entry! Remember, these two Hebrew name choices are covered in vowel points. NOTE: vowel points seem
to change on a single name when viewing it from a different study source. What a mess!

                           Our 2 Hebrew name choices offered to us when crackin open the H3091
                                                          ‫יהושׁע יהושׁוּע‬
                                                     So which one is the right one?

    ‫ולקחת כסף־וזהב ועשית עטרות ושמת בראש יהושע בן־יהוצדק הכהן הגדול׃‬
Now, do you know why I chose this particular Hebrew text in section one of this book during our first peek at The Name?
I chose it because the correct spelling is within the foretelling itself. Go back to section one on page 33, and study the
screen capture from the “Blue Letter Bible” Website. The deception should stick out like a sore thumb by now. The
screen capture shows the five letter name in the original text, has been changed to a six letter name in the “Root Form
Hebrew” column. It is clear, the suffix of shâ/‫ שע‬has been converted to shūâ/‫ שוע‬due to the vowel points. In the English
name of Joshua, you can see the errors in the transliteration. The “J” has replaced the yad/‫ י‬in Yahūshâ/‫יהושע‬.

After reading section two, it’s quite clear that this scripture is the foretelling of The Name of the *Branch. We can now
ignore the misspelling, and vowel points because we have matched the correct spelling in the text. We have solved the first
part of this problem. The next step is to decipher whether the highlighted name in the Hebrew is Jesus, Joshūâ, Jehoshūâ
or something entirely different via transliteration. The stewpot of names within this reference number can keep you from
staying on target if you let them. Your heart can also keep you from seeing the truth. Be prepared, this may sting a little.
The goal is to gather information that agrees with The Name in the Hebrew text. After doing a transliteration of The
Name, we can look into what the H3091 tells us.

                         This Name is found in ZakarYah/Zech 6:11 under the guise of “Joshua”


                                               ‫ע‬          ‫ש‬         ‫ו‬       ‫ה‬         ‫י‬

                                                 A         SH           U      H          Y
                                                        Read from right to left


                                         The actual name is: Y – H – U – SH – A
                             Can you remember the last thing we have to do to prove This Name?
                                          Remember: the H3091 has two roots:

H3091- Origin: from H3068 and H3467 - the “Thayer’s” reports this in the “Jesus” entry: - Definition: Joshua or Jehoshua =
"Jehovah is salvation" . This has to be proven too. We have already disproven the Joshūâ – Jehoshūâ – Jesus - trio by transliteration
alone. Transliteration takes any other name out of the equation. Holding on this far in the book, we already know that * “hovah” is
incorrect and blasphemous. A transliteration of The Name *Yahūah/‫ יהוה‬has already been done earlier. This removes “Jehovah” out
of the equation as well. Let’s take a look at what the H3068 has to say one more time-- and correct in our “BDB”, and “Thayer’s”
what we know is false.


* “hovah” (See p. 66)            *Yahūah/‫( יהוה‬See p. 36)       *Branch (See p. 77)
                                                                                                                    Page 354 of 396

H3068 - Original: ‫יהוה‬- Transliteration: Y@hovah/Yahūah now that His Name is corrected, lets reflect on why we know the
                                                                                                              ‫י‬
“Jehovah” is incorrect: ‘hovah’ (H-1943) means mischief/ruin (p. 66). The “J” is high jacking the Yad/ (See p. 288)
Phonetic: yeh-ho-vaw'-/ya – hoo – ah

Definition: Jehovah/Yahūah = "the existing One" or self existent

a. unpronounced except with the vowel points of 0136 wow! After what we just learned, this one is loaded isn’t it? Let’s pick this one
apart:
unpronounced/Proclaim – this means: “don’t speak The Name.” Try to recall all the things we have learned about this doctrine:
p. 60 tells us about what the Jews say about this; p.107 reveals, we must call out His Name; p.129 discuses it further.

except with the vowel points of 0136/Guard the command – What have we learned? pp. 50, 52-56, 60, 61, 72 and of course,
the 3rd commandment: Shamūṭh/Ex 20:7

                                                   Now, let’s bust open the H3467:

                                    H3091 is a package of treasure. It reveals: 2 roots inside
                                                        3068 and 3467
                           These roots serve as witnesses to the meaning of The Mashýacḥ’s Name:

                                                  Meaning: “Yahūah Delivers”
                                      H3068 represents Yahūah and means self-existent
                                    H3068 - Original: ‫יהוה‬- Transliteration: Y@hovah/Yahūah

                                H3467 is Yashâ/*‫ ישע‬and means: to save; deliverer; delivered
                                          Consistent with “sha” in “yahū-shâ” ‫יהושע‬
                                     Not consistent with “shūâ” in “yahū-shūâ” ‫יהושוע‬

                                                    Self-existent + deliverer =

                                         Yahūah the deliverer or Yahūah is salvation or
                                         Yahūah delivers, Yahūah saves, Yahūah saved

                  No matter how you slice it, This Name, Yahūshâ/‫ יהושע‬is the salvation sent by Yahūah!

                               A Greek Mashýacḥ is nowhere in this. Our Savior is Åbarý.
The name Jesus carries the suffix, sūs/‫ סוס‬in Hebrew; transliterated from G2424/Ἰησοῦς – soos. This suffix is from the
H5483. If the name is of Hebrew origin, then this suffix must be of Hebrew as well. This suffix/root has no deliverance in
it. Remember, everything about this name must be proven.

If only there were
one Lexicon author
commentary in print
today who would
bring into the
equation of this
plethora of debates
on The Name of
‫יהוה‬, the argument
 that the root
 numbers assigned to
 The Name and other
 Hebrew names
 clearly nullify the
 vowel point agenda;
 shrouding The Name.
 These roots are at
war with the points
which change the root
meaning. You can’t
have it both ways!
These arguments
always seem to stay
within the boundaries
of the vowel point
rules. Removing the
points brings the
tetragrammaton
mysteries to a close,
and also opens up a
fury of disconcerting
suspicion against the
creators of the point
system. What will it
take for a single
author to point this
out?

   Semitic Definition: Semitic language that is both a sacred language of Judaism and a modern vernacular in Israel. Like Aramaic, to

    Biblical Hebrew: the earlier parts (“Standard Biblical Hebrew”) date before 500 BC and include even older poetic passages; the later
    parts (“Late Biblical Hebrew”) were composed c. 500–200 BC. Post-Biblical Hebrew, variously termed Rabbinic or Mishnaic Hebrew
                                                                                                                         Page 360 of 396

    (see Mishnah), is characterized by an early period when Hebrew was still probably to some degree a vernacular and a later period,
    after c. AD 200, when Aramaic became the everyday speech of Jews in the Middle East. The 6th and 7th centuries marked a transition
    to Medieval Hebrew. The resurrection of Hebrew as a vernacular is closely linked with the 18th-century Haskala movement and 20th-
    century Zionism. Contemporary Israeli Hebrew is spoken by about five million people in Israel and abroad. See also Ashkenazi;
    Sephardi; Hebrew alphabet. The earliest alphabet used for Hebrew belongs to the Canaanite branch of the North Semitic writing and is
    known as Early Hebrew. Later the Jews adapted the Aramaic writing and evolved from it a script called Square Hebrew, which is the
    source of Modern Hebrew printing. Most Modern Hebrew handwritten text uses a cursive script developed more recently. Today the
    Hebrew alphabet has 22 letters, all consonants. Symbols for the vowels were apparently introduced about the 8th cent. A.D. and are
    usually placed below the consonants if employed. Their use is generally limited to the Bible, verse, and children's books. Hebrew is
    written from right to left. Source: (http://encyclopedia2.thefreedictionary.com/Standard+Hebrew+language)

Shalum in the Set Apart Names of hwhy & [vwhy. This translation of the Model
Prayer is a very basic mechanical translation from English to Hebrew with point of
references from the Greek. Translations from Yiddish (English) back to a root
language (Hebrew) are extremely difficult because so much of the pureness is
already lost. Keeping that in mind, I am no scholar, nor am I professing that this
translation may not have its own set of flaws: NO TRANSLATION ON EARTH IS
FLAWLESS! I pray that this translation serves as a strong building block to assist
you in praying to our Father in true Hebrew. Be advised, the words used for the
Ancient font will differ greatly from Modern Hebrew. Also, when the letter ‘Y’ is
not the first letter of a word…it is pronounced as ‘ee’. Hwhy barak His Set Apart
people: Shalum.

                           Here are the most common resources I use when studying the scriptures.
A trio of eminent Old Testament scholars--Francis Brown, R. Driver, and Charles Briggs--spent over twenty years
researching, writing, and preparing "The Brown-Driver-Briggs Hebrew and English Lexicon."

                                                BDB
                                                A Hebrew and English Lexicon of the Old Testament, more commonly known as
                                                Brown–Driver–Briggs or BDB (from the name of its three authors) is a standard
                                                reference for Biblical Hebrew and Aramaic, first published in 1906. It is organized
                                                by (Hebrew) alphabetical order of three letter roots. It was based on the Hebrew-
                                                German lexicon of Wilhelm Gesenius, translated by Edward Robinson. The chief
                                                editor was Francis Brown, with the co-operation of Samuel Rolles Driver and
                                                Charles Augustus Briggs, hence the name Brown–Driver–Briggs. Some modern
                                                printings have added the Strong's reference numbers for Biblical Hebrew and
                                                Aramaic words. Online Source: (http://en.wikipedia.org)

                                                Since it first appeared in the early part of the twentieth century, BDB has been
                                                considered the finest and most comprehensive Hebrew lexicon available to the
                                                English-speaking student. Based upon the classic work of Wilhelm Gesenius, the
                                                "father of modern Hebrew lexicography," BDB gives not only dictionary definitions
                                                for words, but relates each word to its Old Testament usage and categorizes its
                                                nuances of meaning. BDB's exhaustive coverage of Old Testament Hebrew words,
                                                as well as its unparalleled usage of cognate languages and the wealth of
                                                background sources consulted and quoted, render BDB and invaluable resource for
                                                all students of the Bible. Summary taken from “The Word” software

Renowned Semitists Jo Ann Hackett and John Huehnergard are currently in the process of creating a revision of BDB that incorporates
contemporary scholarship. $35 purchase: can be found on various online sources. Some for better than $30

                                          based on the Masoretic Text and the Greek is from the Textus Receptus. The
sources of the texts are documented in the preface, and are essentially the same (with some minor variations) to the
Hebrew and Greek texts used by the KJV translators. $40 purchase at Amazon.com

TDNT
stands for Theological Dictionary of the New Testament which was edited by Gerhard Kittel and Gerhard
Friedrich and translated from the German by Geoffrey W. Bromiley. This 10-volume set is a standard resource
for in-depth word studies of every word of theological or religious significance in the Greek New Testament. In
the editor's preface, Bromiley states, "While it is not a simple lexicon, it obviously cannot replace either the full
commentary or the biblical theology" (Vol 1, ix). One of the other distinctions of TDNT is its use of many
different contributors.

What Do the Numbers Mean?
When using the lexicon on the Blue Letter Bible for the New Testament, one of the references cited is the
TDNT. Here is the TDNT reference for the word stephanos [4735]:

TDNT - 7:615,1078.

Notice that the first number (7) refers to the volume in which this entry appears. The word "stephanos" is found
in the seventh volume of TDNT.

The second number—appearing after the colon—refers to the page number within that volume. The word
"stephanos" appears on page 615 of the seventh volume.

The last number—appearing after the comma—refers to the page number on which the entry appears in the
abridged addition of the TDNT.

TWOT
stands for Theological Wordbook of the Old Testament edited by R. Laird Harris, Gleason L. Archer, Jr., and
Bruce K. Waltke. TWOT is a 2-volume set, dealing with the Hebrew/Aramaic words in the Old Testament that
have a theological significance. It gives a short definition to every Old Testament word, but goes theologically
in-depth on the words that would be necessary.

What Does the Number Mean?
When using the lexicon on the Blue Letter Bible for the Old Testament, one of the references cited is the
TWOT. Here is the TWOT reference for the word bârâ' [1254]:

TWOT - 278

The number refers to the entry number of the word. The word "bârâ'" is the 278th word in TWOT.

The “Gesenius Lexicon”, available on the “Blue Letter Bible” site, is an excellent study source when digging up word
origins in the Hebrew text. The list of abbreviations however, that riddle this lexicon in each definition, are not located on
the site anywhere; from what I could search out. So, I went on a search online in other areas for the evasive list. This is
what I could dig up for you new students. I may have missed a few, but this list should get you started.

Bible Linguistics have substantially unabbreviated this version of Gesenius' Lexicon. Below is a partial abbreviations index. One
has to be careful with unabbreviating since for example: part. can mean particle OR participle!

SIGNS EMPLOYED

+ (addition) denotes a rendering in the A. V. of one or more Heb. words in connection with the one under consideration.
× (multiplication) denotes a rendering in the A. V. that results from an idiom peculiar to the Heb.
° (degree), appended to a Heb. word, denotes a vowel-pointing corrected from that of the text. (This mark is set in Heb. Bibles
over syllables in which the vowels of the marg. have been inserted instead of those properly belonging to the text.)
( ) (parenthesis), in the renderings from the A. V., denotes a word or syllable sometimes given in connection with the principal
word to which it is annexed.
[ ] (bracket), in the rendering from the A. V., denotes the inclusion of an additional word in the Heb.
Italics, at the end of a rendering from the A. V., denote an explanation of the variations from the usual form.
§123 = Section 123 in Gesenius' Hebrew Grammar.
                                                                                                             Page 380 of 396




As respects PUNCTUATION—it should be noticed, that since only those verbal forms (or their representatives) are given
in the Lexicon which actually occur in the Greek Testament, it becomes necessary to distinguish between a form of the
Present Tense which is in use, and one which is given merely to secure for a verb its place in the alphabet. This is done by
putting a semi-colon after a Present which is a mere alphabetic locum tenens.

Further: a punctuation-mark inserted before a classic voucher or a reference to the Old Testament (whether such voucher
or reference be included in a parenthesis or not) indicates that said voucher or reference applies to other passages,
definitions, etc., besides the one which it immediately follows. The same principle governs the insertion or the omission
of a comma after such abbreviations as "absol.", "pass.", etc.

A hyphen has been placed between the component parts of Greek compounds only in case each separate part is in actual
use; otherwise the hyphen is omitted.

[] Brackets have been used to mark additions by the American editor. To avoid, however, a complexity which might prove
to the reader confusing, they have been occasionally dispensed with when the editorial additions serve only to complete a
statement already made in part by Professor Grimm (as, in enumerating the forms of verbs, the readings of the critical
editors, the verbs compounded with su/n which observe assimilation, etc. etc.); but in no instance have they been
intentionally omitted where the omission might seem to attribute to Professor Grimm an opinion for which he is not
responsible.
* An asterisk at the close of an article indicates that all the instances of the word's occurrence in the New Testament are
noticed in the article. Of the 5594 words composing the vocabulary of the New Testament 5300 are marked with an
asterisk. To this extent, therefore, the present work may serve as a concordance as well as a lexicon. A superior a or b or c
etc. appended to a verse-numeral designates the first, second, third, etc., occurrence of a given word or construction in that
verse. The same letters appended to a page-numeral designate respectively the first, second, third, columns of that page. A
small a. b. c. etc. after a page-numeral designates the subdivision of the page.

The various forms of the GREEK TEXT referred to are represented by the following abbreviations:

R or Rec. = what is commonly known as the Textus Receptus. Dr. F. H. A. Scrivener's last edition (Cambridge and
London 1877) has been taken as the standard.1 To designate a particular form of this "Protean text" an abbreviation has
been appended in superior type; as, elz for Elzevir, st for Stephen, bez for Beza, eras for Erasmus.
G or Grsb. = the Greek text of Griesbach as given in his manual edition, 2 vols., Leipzig, 1805. Owing to a disregard of
the signs by which Griesbach indicated his judgment respecting the various degrees of probability belonging to different
readings, he is cited not infrequently, even in critical works, as supporting readings which he expressly questioned, but
was not quite ready to expel from the text.
L or Lchm. = Lachmann's Greek text as given in his larger edition, 2 vols., Berlin, 1842 and 1850. When the text of his
smaller or stereotyped edition (Berlin, 1831) is referred to, the abbreviation "min." or "ster." is added to his initial.
T or Tdf. = the text of Tischendorf's "Editio Octava Critica Major" (Leipzig, 1869-1872).
Tr or Treg. = "The Greek New Testament" etc. by S. P. Tregelles (London, 1857-1872).
WH = "The New Testament in the Original Greek. The Text Revised by Brooke Foss Westcott D.D. and Fenton John
Anthony Hort D.D. Cambridge and London, Macmillan and Co. 1881."
KC = "Novum Testamentum ad Fidem Codicis Vaticani" as edited by Professors Kuenen and Cobet (Leyden, 1860).
The textual variations noticed are of course mainly those which affect the individual word or construction under
discussion. Where an extended passage or entire section is textually debatable (as, for example, Mk. xvi. 9-20; Jn. v. 3
fin.—4; vii. 53 fin.—viii. 11), that fact is assumed to be known, or at least it is not stated under every word contained in
the passage.

As respects the NUMBERING OF THE VERSES — the edition of Robert Stephen, in 2 vols. 16°, Geneva 1551, has been
followed as the standard (as it is in the critical editions of Tregelles, Westcott and Hort, etc.). Variations from this
standard are indicated by subjoining the variant verse-numeral within marks of parenthesis. The similar addition in the
case of references to the Old Testament indicates the variation between the Hebrew notation and the Greek.
                                                                                                        Page 381 of 396

In quotations from the ENGLISH BIBLE—

A. V. = the current or so-called "Authorized Version";
R. V. = the Revised New Testament of 1881. But when a rendering is ascribed to the former version it may be assumed to

                                                          Greek Chart Key
δ *(thel-tah) - known as the ‘Delta’, has a hard th sound in today’s Greek: Thad; thick; thimble; think; thwart; thistle
θ *(thee-tah) - known as the ‘Theta’, has a more softer th sound in today’s Greek: that; they; then; this; them; those; their; the
η *(ee-tah) - known as the ‘Eta’. After the 5th century, the sound of this letter merged with the ‘Yotah’.
ι *(yo-tah) - known as the ‘Iota’- These three letters are equivalent in sound in today’s Greek; making the long ‘e’ sound.
υ *(eep-see-lon) - known as the ‘Upsilon’.

ξ *(ksee) - known as the ‘Xi’ (zie), has the x sound in today’s Greek. The x is pronounced by removing the ‘eh’ in ‘eks’.
ρ *(roe) - In today’s Greek, the r in ‘Roe’, is ‘rolled’ by the tongue like in the Spanish language.
χ *(khy) - The ‘Chi’ sound is similar to the Hebrew Ḥaṭh/‫ח‬. The Ḥaṭh/‫ ח‬sound, comes from the back of the throat. The ‘Chi’
sound, comes from pushing air between the tongue and the roof of the mouth (a scratchy sound), while pronouncing ‘he’.

σ ς *(seeġ-mah) - known as ‘sigma’, has a third form: ς used only at the end of a word.
*ġ    - this ġ, with the diacritic mark on top, is pronounced like the French r, from the back of the throat; a soft gurgling sound
   It is thoroughly and utterly impossible- etymologically, historically, linguistically and
                scripturally for any name to sit in the seat of Self- Existence:
                                      -Other Than The Self-Existent One-

   Since the days of old man has cried out to one mightier than himself to escape wars,
  famines, persecution, sickness, enemies seen and unseen, self made snares and certain
  death. It is written in the Hebrew scriptures, one specific Name to cry out to; given to
  man by our Creator. One Name that cannot be detected in the abundance of Bibles in
                     print around the world today-until this generation.

     Through these findings in the Hebrew text it would be difficult to deny: that after
  peeling back the ignorance, coming face to face with hidden errors, outright deceptive
    hindrances and misinterpretations that have been cleverly weaved into our English
    translation of the Hebrew text, This One Name; in all of its claims with over 500 +
 witnesses recorded in this document alone; The Only Name proclaimed repeatedly in the
 Hebrew text, is without a doubt, in its self-proclaiming state of Self-Existence, The most
 sought after; The most hated; The most disputed Name in documented history, and that
            any other such record of proclamation would pale in comparison.

 Evidence found in The Name of our Creator and in the names of His Servants has been
 uncovered in these last days. This evidence has been hidden for centuries within the first
 3 characters of This Name which was and still is shared by all those who live and die for
  the sake of This Name. How important is This Name? Why do the Jews refuse to speak
   the only name we can call on for salvation according to Yahu'al/Joel 2:32? How deep
  does the deception go about this one Name and what does the Hebrew text really say?


    You are now invited to observe the testimony of over 500 witnesses defending the
      Name of The Father and His Son. A name that has been hated for centuries.
                     THE NAME OF YAHUAH AND YAHUSHA
                       This evidence simply cannot stay hidden!
